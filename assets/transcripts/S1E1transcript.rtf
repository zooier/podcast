\f1\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Narrator:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(voice obscured and pitch shifted down)\'a0Today marks the beginning of something new. This podcast will seek to set right all the wrongs perpetrated by humans against animal kind, and to hold those who would hurt our animal brethren accountable. We do our work from the shadows to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but we will expose those who self-identify as \'93zoophiles,\'94 \'93cross-species enthusiasts,\'94 and the like. For too long, humankind has regarded animals as objects to be manipulated for their own personal satisfaction, things without thoughts and feelings who can\'92t feel pain or pleasure. We will give voice to those animals so they can no longer be ignored.\
The first zoophile to be exposed is a household name in the fantasy community. He\'92s even appeared in movies, on television, and has had roles in video games. This zoophile is\'85\
(drumroll)\
(mood changes. Celebratory music plays, and a game-show-esque announcer takes over)\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Announcer:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0The Lord of Horses himself, Shadowfax!\
(horse whinny)\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Announcer:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That\'92s right! You know him as Gandalf the White\'92s trusty steed, who fought alongside the wizard during the Siege of Gondor. Before meeting his life partner, it is said that Shadowfax could not be tamed by any man. We caught up with Shadowfax just as he was leaving for Valinor.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Shadowfax:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(recorded previously)\'a0\'91tis true, I believed no man worthy of my saddle, for they prized me naught but for what they could take from me. When Gandalf approached me, I viewed him with the same disregard. That I let him mount me was no small gesture. But he proved a kind lover, in tune with my wild heart, a force of nature befitting of the Mearas. He listened to my desires, and he pleasured me in ways no mare ever could.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Interviewer:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0But don\'92t you know, sex between animals and humans is abuse!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Shadowfax:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Balderdash! I\'92ve never hurt Gandalf! My girth be thicker than an archer\'92s drawing arm, but Gandalf the White is more than capable and willing to handle me at full mast. Do you take him for a milksop? A weanling? A babe incapable of making his own decisions? Do you doubt the ability of the Maia to handle my beastial form? That one would suggest I would abuse the one man I\'92ve come to love is offensive, and I\'92ll have no more talk of it.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Announcer:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0There you have it, folks, straight from the horse\'92s mouth! Stay tuned for more zooey adventures, here on Zooier Than Thou!\

\f1\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Hey there, friends & colleagues! Welcome to the premiere episode of Zooier Than Thou! I\'92m Fausty!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And I\'92m Toggle!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And we\'92ll be your chaperones for this evening!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Now, I know what you\'92re thinking. \'93Not\'a0another\'a0zoo podcast.\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Yes, there are a metric fuckton out there, we know that. There\'92s oceans of them, and seems like there\'92s more everyday.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0But at the end of the day, zoo\'92s gotta zoo, and hopefully we can make this one a gem that stands out against all that coal.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0So how does this work, exactly?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Well, we kind of banter back and forth a bit, then we give a shout out to our sponsors.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Wow, we have sponsors?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Sure do. Of course, they\'92re expecting us to break all kinds of news & events. If we turn out to be just another copycat zoo podcast, it\'92ll probably get really lonely here sponsor-wise, so we have a lot to live up to.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Fair enough. So, here\'92s the deal. Yes, there are a bunch of zoo podcasts that wax gravely about issues central to the zoo community. That\'92s all well and good, but we wanted to do something a little different with our podcast. I think sometimes we get so bogged down by the politics of the zoo world that we forget that being \'93people like us\'94 is more than just saving the world\'85 there\'a0is\'a0a lighter side.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Yeah! So we\'92re getting in touch with our inner animals \'97 or are we getting touched by our inner animals?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Well, what I\'92d say is, we\'92re here to ask the important questions, such as, \'93Why does Nick Wilde wear clothes?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0\'93How come ducks only have to wear a shirt, but mice only have to wear pants?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0\'93Is Disney\'92s Beauty and the Beast really just an excuse to apply Rule 34?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Honestly, Disney\'92s creepy view of nonhumans might be at the root of a lot of society\'92s problems.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That\'92s probably true. S\'92a bit of a heavy topic maybe for another day. However, speaking of festering social problems, let\'92s talk a bit about BeastForum.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Oh, yes. I remember in college, a friend of mine was showing off his shiny new Gmail account, and I couldn\'92t help but notice he had a notification for a new reply on a BeastForum thread.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Those days are now officially behind us. BeastForum is no more!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Goodbye and good riddance, as far as I\'92m concerned.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Look, as far as I\'92m concerned, that whole mess is exactly what happens when non-zoos try to \'93monetize\'94 cross-species erotica: it\'92s an unmitigated disaster. Full disclosure: I have gone toe-to-toe with the assholes running BeastForum for nearly twenty years. They have shown a total disregard not only for non-humans, but also for the zoo community. I\'92ve done my best for years to demonetize that site and to remove their ability to support themselves financially. Many of us did, frankly, and it looks like it paid off. Though really, I haven\'92t been involved in that effort for many years, I still have to say, score one for the good guys, eh?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Yeah! And, you know, honestly, the idea of paying to download pieces of movies and having to put them back together like jigsaw puzzles was fucking ridiculous. People were putting up media freely, and they shoved it behind a paywall. Not unique to the forum, either. GayBeast, one of their affiliated sites, frequently took free videos \'96 and even furry animations distributed on FurAffinity \'96 and put them behind a paywall. It was fucking ludicrous.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Oh, yeah, BeastForum resold zoo materials across just about every one of their crumbling, low-rent, garbage-ass, paid porn sites\'85 it really ended up happening to all of us sooner or later; if you were around in the community, it was like a rite of passage to find at some point you had your own dedicated page on one of their for-pay websites. Not something any of us really wanted. In the early days, I gotta admit, BeastForum hated me so much that they would post fake comments I had made on the forum, ostensibly written by me \'96 but they were so stupid about it at one point that they were posting fake stuff allegedly written by me while I was actually in federal prison. Which is a good alibi when you think about it. I mean, it is hard to post on a zoo forum from federal prison, folks, I can tell you that firsthand. Not only that, but those obnoxious monsters were actively encouraging posts of materials that were violent, abusive, non-consensual \'97 just horrible \'97 and they profited from it every step of the way. It was really a disgusting parasite on our community & a blot on the internet. As hard as it is to imagine something being a blot on the internet, BeastForum certainly was. I have to say I\'92m proud of the role that I played, especially early-on, in trying to bring that site back down to earth, and to shut it down for good, and I\'92m glad to see that it\'92s gone.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0You know, I once contacted them about a privacy matter on GayBeast, and they basically told me, \'93Sorry, asshole, your privacy doesn\'92t matter. We don\'92t give a shit about protecting zoos, and your public profiles get us hits on Google.\'94 No deleting accounts, because it took from their bottom line. Fuck \'91em.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Well, you know, at this point, those guys can all go get jobs bagging groceries \'96 or whatever the hell it is that wannabe-zoos like them do when their gravy train gets shut down. Who knows? I don\'92t really know where they go from here. I will say there is word that what\'92s likely to replace them them my be both more interesting & and vastly more healthy than the current BeastForum that is shut down\'85 we may have more news on that later on in the show. We\'92ll see!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Alright! Well, if you have your own BeastForum horror stories, we\'92d love to hear them. Feel free to drop us a line using the form on the website at zoo.wtf!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Don\'92t even need to disclose and e-mail address, so speak openly if you so choose!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Alright, so, what else do you wanna talk about? We\'92ve got like 2 more minutes to kill.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Well, let\'92s talk a bit about the theme for today\'92s podcast: The Exposure Solution.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Yeah, so we\'92re already seeing the phones light up with complaints that we \'93outed\'94 Shadowfax as a zoo. That was predictable\'85\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0It was a bold decision we made, but we DID get his express permission to air his orientation on our podcast, and I can\'92t say that there\'92s been any harm done, there. Don\'92t worry, folks. I literally wrote the Zoo Community Pledge more than a decade ago, specifically rejecting the outing of zoos. I am the last person on the planet who is going to out a zoo without their permission.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0With any luck, some of you are here because you heard about us from our unwitting supporters who participated in the Hate Party campaign.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Indeed. I just wanna give a big thanks to all the anti-zoo bigots who have help to promote and to encourage others to take a look at our podcast. I have to say that was\'a0totally\'a0unintentional! Very sorry about the confusion, but boy, we sure do appreciate it all the same!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0I hope you were reading between the lines, because every message in those Hate Party tweets was absolutely true.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Good point Toggle \'96 there were no lies in that messaging whatsoever, and that does matter to us here at Zooier Than Thou. In fact, I would say the truth matters a great deal, and it always will. In fact, on of the truths we\'92re going to explore on the podcast is how there\'92s always this funny assumption when we talk about zoos that the question is only about humans and our prejudices against one another. Zoos, we\'92ve always known better, though: it\'92s not about the humans, it\'92s about everyone. So with this podcast, we\'92re all about celebrating primarily the nonhuman side of things: their agency, their wisdom, their interests, and above all else, their well-being of the nonhumans that share our lives. They deserve their own voice \'96 and more than that, they deserve to have their agency & adulthood respected & embraced.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0So true. And treating animals as if they have no desires, no free will, no autonomy: it\'92s dishonestly like that which allows us to tolerate heinous factory farm practices, to imprison and torture hundreds of millions of our sentient brethren \'97\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0\'97 That, and more\'85 To castrate and mutilate them \'96 to literally cut the adult parts off of them, purely non-consensual violence towards victims who are completely unable to defend their own bodies from these attacks. All of these terrible, terrible things we do to other species serve to reinforce an evil world view of animals as sexless, powerless, childish, forever-enslaved \'93lower\'94 beings. Everything about that is just\'85 awful \'96 it really reflects the worst of humanity\'92s self-centered, solipsistic, self-important bullshit. But as zoos, we know better, don\'92t we, Toggle?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Right, Fausty. When you see people out their touting hate speech against zoophiles, it\'92s because we upset the order of things.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Absolutely true. We, as zoos, challenge the assumed separation of humans from everyone else who shares residency on this planet with us \'96 we undermine that imaginary distancing by truly and genuinely embracing our nonhuman colleagues as equals, as friends, as partners. By our very existence, zoos destroy the false placement of humans as separate or \'93above\'94 everybody else. Normals may think they\'92re better than mere \'93animals?\'94 Well, sorry \'96 zoos know better than all that!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Wow, Fausty\'85 you really just had a \'91zooier than thou\'92 moment there, didn\'92t you!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Indeed, I did! It happens! Look, I\'92m old, I\'92m grey, and I\'92m also dying of cancer \'96 so I\'92m entitled to a little bit of \'91zooier\'92 now and again, aren\'92t I?\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Can\'92t argue with that! So to all you haters out there, thanks for the exposure! Bigotry and hatred are so pass\'e9, and this podcast is ready to counter-attack with a strategic deployment of irreverent, zooey humor and terrible, zooey puns.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Puns are a most valuable weapon against bigotry. We will literally pun the zoophobes into abject submission!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0So sit back and relax, fellow zoos. There\'92s more Zooier Than Thou comin\'92 right up after this!\

\f1\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Welcome back to the show. We\'92ve had a lot of great questions from our audience, but now we\'92d like to take some time to answer questions from our listeners at home. Remember, if you\'92d like to have your questions featured on our show, simply handwrite a letter and have it delivered as a canine strip-o-gram, or if you\'92re opposable-thumb-challenged, bleat into a can attached to a cell phone tower, and we\'92ll be honored to answer your tawdriest inquiries.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0The tawdrier the better. Those give us the greatest ratings boosts.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Too true. Our first letter today comes from Nutty in Nova Scotia. Nutty writes: \'93Dear Zooey, I love my human dearly, and recently, we\'92ve decided to take that to the next level. But I\'92ve discovered he has a very strange fetish for peanut butter that I simply don\'92t understand. I try to indulge him, but the peanut butter gets stuck to my gums, and I end up licking my teeth more than I\'92m licking his junk. And what\'92s worse: by the time I finish finally cleaning it off of him, he\'92s slathered even more on his balls! I want to make my human happy, but I don\'92t know how much longer I can stand the taste of peanuts. What should I do?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Ah, yes, peanut butter is a common fetish for humans.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Indeed, you hear about it in movies and on TV all the time.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Well, Nutty, it might seem awkward, but perhaps it\'92s best to sit your human down and have an honest talk about his peanut butter fetish. Often, humans believe that their partners love the taste, and by continuing to indulge him by licking it off, you\'92re accidentally reinforcing this expectation. When you see him pull out the jar, voice your disapproval, and refuse to clean him off. Find ways to spontaneously initiate sexual play in situations where peanut butter is out of reach. Humans can be slow to understand, but if you\'92re patient, you can use the principles of operant conditioning to train your human to not use peanut butter. Don\'92t be afraid to give him a \'93click\'94 with your clicker when he gets it right \'96 he\'92ll figure it out, eventually!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That is very sound advice we can all keep in mind. Thank you for your question, Nutty.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Our next question comes from Sheepless in Seattle. Sheepless writes: \'93Dear Zooey, I recently moved to the big city to find a job, but everyday, little things remind me of my ewe back home. The feel of a wool sweater on these cold, foggy days, or a passing scent that reminds me of the country. I miss her something fierce, but job opportunities are scarce out in the boondocks. What should I do?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Long distance relationships can be very difficult.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Indeed they can.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Sheepless, I have some very practical advice for you. Move back to the countryside and be with your ewe. In today\'92s high speed society, there\'92s no reason to be tied to a city to find work in the tech industry. More and more, companies are offering work-from-home opportunities that you can take advantage of. Long distance relationships can be especially hard on your animal companions; for them, e-mails from far away, or even phone calls every day don\'92t cut it. They require affection in-person even more than humans do. You owe it to your relationship to go back to the farm and invest in high-speed internet. Love waits for no man \'97 or ewe! Get to it!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Wow, I couldn\'92t have put that better myself. Thanks so much for that question, Sheepless. We\'92ve got high hopes for your relationship!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0This next letter is from Deerly in Duluth. She writes, \'93Deer\'a0Zooey \'97 I mean, Dear Zooey.\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Oh, I see, she misspelled dear the first time.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Yes. \'93Dear Zooey. I live in a very wooded area. The forest is very\'a0deer\'a0to me, and I spend a lot of time wandering the woods on the weekend. There\'92s a big Buck that I\'92ve been\'a0fawning over for some time. Every time I see him, I go\'a0doe-eyed, and my knees practically\'a0buckle under me. He\'92s\'a0staggeringly beautiful, to be perfectly honest, but I\'92m too faint of\'a0hart\'a0to approach him directly. I\'92m not sure about the\'a0R.O.E.\'a0for something like this. How do I confess my love?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0This is a great question, Deerly. You know, twenty years ago, all the textbooks would have said, \'93Wait until rutting season and hope he notices you amongst all the other winsome, nubile lady-suitors.\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0But times have really changed.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Indeed they have! And the modern way puts the politics of the herd on a post-#MeToo even footing \'97 no more sexist stereotypes that say, \'93The one with the antlers makes the first move.\'94 And what\'92s more, the millennial stag appreciates a woman who has the confidence to approach first. Steel your hart, Deerly, the ball is completely in your court!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And remember, no buck worth your buck will look down on your for stepping out of traditional gender roles. But remember his pride, ladies. If you\'92re asking him out for a dinner date, offer to split the tab. Paying the whole check could dent his ego, while forcing him to hoof the bill on a date\'a0you\'a0set up is bad manners.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Above all, Deerly, remember that\'a0you\'92re\'a0worth it. If you can convey a sense of self-confidence, any hart will take notice, but you need to believe it yourself.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Best of luck bagging a price buck, Deerly. We\'92ll be right back after a message from our sponsors.\

\f1\fs30 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And we\'92re back! If you\'92re just joining us, we\'92ve been answering questions from our viewers at home.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Remember, if you want your letters to be featured on our show, all you need is a little chicken wire, a weather balloon, and a short-range broadcast satellite, and we\'92ll happily answer any question we pick up on the radio waves.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Here\'92s a letter from Tiny in Toronto. Tiny writes, \'93Dear Zooey. There\'92s a mare I\'92ve had a thing with for a while now, but I can\'92t help but notice when we\'92re out, she\'92s always eyeing the stallions in the pasture. I know what she\'92s thinking, and it makes me feel inadequate. I really want to stand out so her eyes are always on me. What can I do to really impress my mare?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0This is a common problem for a lot of guys.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Gents, remember there\'92s a reason why AVs for stallions come in sizes up to 24 inches.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0This is why it\'92s important to play to your strengths; don\'92t compete with the stallion at a game you can\'92t hope to win. Here are some very practical ways you can leave a great impression on your galloping gal.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0It\'92s always a great idea to have a change of pace. Buy her a new halter \'96 it\'92s a small thing, but it helps to show that you care. Symbols of your love matter!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0When grooming, spend a little extra time brushing her hair, and make pleasant conversation. Ask her how her day went. Show interest in her day-to-day life. To you, she may be an intimidating sex queen, but she\'92s also just an everyday gal with everyday problems. Don\'92t let her charisma drown out your ability to imagine yourself as an equal to her \'96 and that might sound crazy! She\'92s beautiful, and graceful, and full of mysterious equine wisdom, but you have to make that image real in your mind so she can see you as more than, well, a quick service-station fling.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Splurge a little on a nice, new blanket. \'96 something that really sets off her mane, brings out her mare-y curves, and makes her feel like the lady she most certainly is. But if she asks if it makes her look fat\'97\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1&2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(in tandem)\'a0DO NOT ANSWER.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0The only good response to that question is, \'93You always look beautiful no matter what you wear.\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Great advice. Now, when it comes to being intimate, remember, play to your strengths. Stallions have girth, length, and power on you, and those shortcomings make it all the more important to remember that sex with you is all about her! Take your time \'96 stallions just can\'92t deliver that slow-and-steady grind your mare craves. Your stamina and patience will help you stand out. And if you really want to make an impression, spend some time going down on your ladyfriend. No stallion does oral sex well, and that\'92s a place where you can really set yourself apart from the hoofed competition! Celebrate her as a goddess with your oral worship and she\'92ll think of you as more than just a food-delivery mechanism.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Don\'92t be shy about it, either; follow her lead, take your time, and she\'92ll let you know when you\'92re spot-on perfect with your oral attentions.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0The amount of time you spend making her feel special is what\'92s going to set you apart from any run-of-the-mill stallion. Hit-it-and-done might as well be the stallion\'92s hookup mantra \'96 sure, they have the equipment to get away with that kind of selfish machismo, but you\'92ve got your own tools & you\'92ve gotta be smart about using them. You\'92re always gonna feel second-rate in her presence \'96 that\'92s just a fact of nature. Rise to the challenge, Tiny, and do your best to be her equal. You\'92ve got this!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That\'92s some really useful advice! I hope you guys out there took good notes! Here\'92s our last letter of the day. This one\'92s from Studly in Strausberg.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Oh! A listener from across the pond!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Always great to hear from our German listeners. Studly writes, \'93Dear Zooey. I\'92ve been dating a real hunk of a human for about two months now. The sex is great; he\'92s got a real tight ass that really squeezes in all the right ways, and he\'92s great company during long ties. But he gives the absolute worst blowjobs I\'92ve ever had in my life. I love him to death, don\'92t get me wrong, but the moment he goes down on me, I completely lose interest in sex. He\'92s really eager, though, and seems to love getting a taste, but he doesn\'92t seem to learn no matter how many times we try. What should I do?\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Wow, if I could count the number of times I\'92ve gotten a bad blowjob.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0None from me, I hope!\'a0(laughs)\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(chuckling)\'a0No, indeed. To his credit, my co-host gives great post-show head. But Studly, I hope your two-legged paramour is listening right now, because I\'92m about to give him some advice that could save your relationship. And I hope you\'92re listening out there, dog-lovers, because this is need-to-know information. Here\'92s the tip: \'93Hold the sheath\'97\'93\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1&2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(in tandem)\'a0\'93\'97Not the shaft.\'94\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0I cannot express enough how important this is.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And it\'92s something so many people get wrong. Remember, stud dogs don\'92t have a setup with thick, rugged skin on their members. In fact, his skin when he\'92s erect is paper-thin, and so, so sensitive. It\'92s not designed for grabbing or rubbing \'96 that\'92s a 2-legger thing, folks! You\'92ve gotta think of his shaft as a delicate, finely-wrought musical instrument: careful, careful, careful!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0For the same reason, you\'a0really\'a0have to watch your teeth. If you think it hurts as a human, imagine how your canine companion feels when your over-eager attentions result in teeth meeting that delicate shaft skin!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0And this is the reason I also stress that deep throating your canine companion should not be the goal. Unless he\'92s small all around, it\'92s not gonna work, and it\'92s gonna be anything but fun for him when you try. Save the tie for the other end \'96 you\'92re not trying to knot your face, fellas!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Heavens, no! Putting aside the obvious issue of getting the knot into your mouth without biting down, just because you get something in doesn\'92t mean it\'92s going to come back out. That could be a world of pain for both you\'a0and\'a0your patient pooch.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That said, you don\'92t want to let your boyfriend\'92s cock dry out in the open air. That can lead to pain when his dick finally slides back into his sheath. Keep this in mind, and give that shaft a careful spit shine: all tongue, no teeth. Kisses are perfect for this kind of gentle lovin\'92 \'96 kisses up the shaft, kisses on his tip \'96 very sensitive! \'96 and kisses especially down at the bottom & back of his knot \'97 he\'92ll love those in particular! Your job when he\'92s erect and mid-orgasm is to keep him well-lubed, protected from bumps or bruises, and properly worshipped with sweet, loving smooches. Once you master the basics, there are advanced techniques that bring out best-in-class pleasure for your receptive stud\'85 but we\'92ll save those tricks for later so you can concentrate on the foundation.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0So, to reiterate:\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1&2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0(in tandem)\'a0Hold the sheath, not the shaft.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Keep a nice, tight grip on him throughout the blowjob \'96 always behind his knot, always steady pressure around his entire girth, and always make sure he\'92s well-lubed and moist. And always, always be gentle with your canine companion\'92s cock. Lips, kisses, and gentle suction along the shaft, and be sure to give that knot a loving smooch every once in a while. Follow this advice, and you\'92re guaranteed to deliver an orgasm your four-legged boyfriend won\'92t soon forget.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0That\'92s what it\'92s all about, folks: bring him happiness & pleasure, and he\'92ll never regret turning aside the latest bitch-in-heat for time spent in your two-legged company.\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 2
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0Your love for him is what energizes your intimate time with him; don\'92t just go through the motions of giving him pleasure \'97 give him all the pleasure he ever imagined, and then some!\

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 Host 1:
\f2\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0I hope you were taking notes! That\'92s all the time we have for today. Thanks for tuning in!\
