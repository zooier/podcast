\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Hello, fellow zoos, and welcome to a very important new moon episode of Zooier Than Thou. I\'92m Fausty.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0And I\'92m Toggle, Doug Spink\'92s faithful lackey slash peon.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0And we\'92ll be your steadfast guides for this episode.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0We got a lot of positive comments on our last episode, but one of the funniest for us was, \'93Please stop doing comedy!\'94 Well, the good news is, we really don\'92t have a lot of funny things to say tonight. Suffice it to say, the past two weeks since the last episode have been intense.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0We\'92re going to attempt to lay everything out and make sense of it for you, tell you how we got to where we are now, and tell you what happens going forward. There\'92s a lot to unpack, and a lot of it\'92s unpleasant, but we feel like it\'92s very important to talk about.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0It started with the first e-mail we received, from someone called Shadowwoof who claimed to have insider knowledge of what happened with regards to Kero and the first leaks. He said, \'93I deal with this stuff. If you\'92re really in doubt, talk to me personally.\'94 And of course, he sent a link to a giant telegram archive which we specifically said we didn\'92t want. So I told him to contact Fausty, and he did.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0This guy came out of the door swinging. \'93I\'92ve been watching you for some time,\'94 just boasting and intimidating from the start. He said he had solid proof on Kero. Ok, so prove it. He couldn\'92t. Eventually, he conceded that there was no hard proof that Kero actually did anything, that everything was circumstantial. He then proceeded to tell me that he knew where I lived. Did you know I lived in Chicago, Toggle?\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Wow, that\'92s news to me! I could have sworn you explicitly said you lived in Harmony, Pennsylvania on one of our episodes for everyone to hear. Such savvy misdirection on your part!\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0This is one of those conversations that\'92s really difficult to gloss or summarise. Early on, he threatens me with some sort of dire consequences \'96 not sure what I was or was not supposed to do to avoid this, but oh well. My immediate reaction, as is my usual policy, was to tell him to go ahead and do it \'96 whatever \'93it\'94 is. Best way to deal with threats is to jump right to the money shot and get it over with. Then you can loop back and continue doing what you were doing. Next I\'92m told I am dealing with the Leader of Online Zoos. Literally, that\'92s the title. This runs in circles, never leaving surreal along the way. I\'92m banned from a Telegram group I don\'92t belong to, accused of trying to out someone along the way (no idea who), reminded of dire consequences\'85 basically we\'92re going nowhere and I need a second set of eyes because I can\'92t make sense of any of this.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0At some point, Fausty pulled me into a group chat with this guy, and I\'92m already like, I want nothing to do with him. So we\'92re in this chat, with three different versions of Shadow, and he messages me on one of them like, \'93why are in you in this chat?\'94 And I\'92m like, \'93I was added to the chat.\'94 And he says, \'93Leave.\'94 So obviously, I didn\'92t leave, even though I wanted to. He called me a peon and a lackey, which was incredibly insulting, by the way, the whole time thrashing about and making demands. It became clear this guy was used to throwing his weight around and getting what he wanted out of people, and I wasn\'92t interested in being bullied around. So he kept harping about how we didn\'92t have any leverage on him, we couldn\'92t prove anything, you know, the types of things people don\'92t usually say when they\'92re innocent.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0That concept of \'93leverage\'94 and who does or does not have it has been put to me more in the past two weeks than in all the rest of my life. I\'92ve been told I don\'92t have leverage over people I don\'92t even know, apropos of nothing, more than once. Leverage? In this case, it\'92s someone who contacted us promising to correct errors in our last episode \'96 we got from there to leverage in no time whatsoever. And remember: this guy comes to us claiming to have info on Kero, and he doesn\'92t. Strike one. He threatens me, and tries to intimidate Toggle. Strike two. Then he claims credit for nailing the guy in Cuba, and that\'92s strike out, buddy. Also there\'92s more strikes \'96 correcting errors that he never even points out let alone corrects, threatening me with who-knows-what for no idea reason, creepy insinuations of being \'93local\'94 to me by repeatedly sending me pictures of hot dogs\'85 yes, hot dogs \'96 but really who\'92s counting by now? I\'92m ready to write off this guy as harmless but crazy, just a bunch of 2-legger politics and weird zoo power dynamics\'85 unfortunate, but unfortunately not uncommon. But then, something kind of clicked. Nobody legitimate uses zoosadism as background music for their Telegram shenanigans, do they? It\'92s at first just a hunch, a sense that there\'92s no possible way a discussion like this happens with someone living in what I now think of as the non-torture world. So I kept pressing him, by now so flagrantly that it risks tipping over into satire. This is completely not-fun, but I had a sense it might just pay off. It did.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0I was like, \'93I don\'92t know why you\'92re still goading him. But then fausty\'92s like, \'93This is why,\'94 and sends me a forwarded message Shadow sent from Akela accusing him of being a zoosadist. \'93After all,\'94 Akela writes, \'93the best way to hide as something is to pretend to be against the exact same thing.\'94\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Shadow sent me that to prove that he was friends with Akela? I have no real idea what he thought he was doing, but he went right into defensive mode after that. \'93Show me literally anything you have on me that links me stronger to zoosadism than Kero. Prove it. You can\'92t.\'94 That\'92s not how someone not tied up in this shit acts when confronted with such an accusation. This is something else we\'92ve seen way too much of the past two weeks: ask someone if they are a torturing sadist, and their reply is \'93you can\'92t prove that, there\'92s no proof.\'94 Well ok\'85 I mean an answer like that probably wouldn\'92t convince a 12-person jury beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt, buuuuut\'85 I can count how many times I\'92ve ever had that reply from anyone in my entire life, before this past 2 weeks, on one paw with toes to spare. Given that I\'92ve spent about six years of my life in various federal prisons, that\'92s kind of an interesting statistic.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0The conversation just got weirder and exponentially darker from there. Shadow started throwing everyone he could under the bus. He accused Akela of a profoundly destructive prediliction, after harping on what good friends they were. Brags that he\'92s untraceable, that he\'92s deleted all the evidence\'85 deleted all the evidence! \'96 even though of course fausty\'92s been screencapping everything in real time, says that he\'92ll just claim that the conversations are faked. Then the unthinkable happens.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Well I\'92d been trying to make a Telegram voice connection for a while at the end of the chat \'96 mostly just to show that we\'92re still in reality-land here, and that we\'92re still just two male humans exchanging language. Bring things back to stable ground, as it were \'96 text chat can get pretty weird if left to its own devices. And he\'92s not answering, and I\'92m not surprised. But then, after I tell him I\'92ve heard all I need to know and I\'92ve got things to do, he calls me back. I take the call, tell him I\'92m recording it so I can share it with others if necessary, and confirm he\'92s ok with being recorded. He says yes. And I step through how I feel like our chat just went, what I feel like he\'92s tacitly admitted to being and doing, and how I feel it\'92s necessary to respond to such admissions. And by now he\'92s going backwards, denying having admitted anything, claiming to be the scourge of torturing sadists, and so on. I tell him he can\'92t even fucking figure out where I live from the hints such as me saying where I live in the last podcast episode he claims he\'92s calling in to correct errors in, so I\'92m not sure I can imagine him being the scourge of anything. Eventually I simply told him I\'92d heard what I needed, and that anyone else working with us could listen to the call, read the chat, and come to their own conclusions. My work, I told him, was done in this and he\'92d have to answer to folks with alot more power and authority than I in all this. By then, about six hours into this interaction, I admit that I\'92m fed up and angry. This is about god-damned torture of animals, and somehow this asshole has run in circles all the time without showing any signs he gives a shit about that. Like so much else we\'92ll soon experience, he seems much more focussed on the politics and appearance and power dynamics at play between different people and groups\'85 and the rounding error is torture. Well I\'92m sorry, but fuck that \'96 backwards priorities for me. Basically, I\'92ve concluded this guy is deep in the entire swirl of sadists and violent monsters we\'92re zeroing in on, and in his own words he\'92s functionally labelled himself as one already. So I\'92m done, call\'92s over. Oh and one more thing: in those hours of talking, he\'92s not once brought up nonhumans, concern for nonhumans, or frankly anything even vaguely zooish in any way. This was 100% 2-legger power politics\'85 from the ersatz Leader of Online Zoos. Fucking whatever, man.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0We felt the next best move was to talk to Akela, let him know what Shadow was saying, and find out his side of the story. We\'92re told that, immediately after fausty finished his call, Shadow went totally ape shit in the zooadmin telegram chat, threatening to go public with some logs that were under federal investigation in retaliation against Akela, whom he thought we\'92d already contacted but hadn\'92t. We\'92re getting pinged from every direction, asking us what the hell just happened, and we\'92re kind of not sure how to answer.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Yep. From total strangers and old contact alike, I\'92m getting asked: \'93Man, what the fuck did you guys do? Shadow\'92s going apeshit!\'94 Since then, we\'92ve been slowly filling in the bigger picture piece by disgusting piece. It\'92s been a really unpleasant process.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Oh, and keep in mind, in the background, Shadowwoof is spinning up fake accounts to message saying, \'93Hi, Fausty, Shadow\'92s not such a bad guy! Be nice to him!\'94 It\'92s like some bad parody of sockpuppeting, really only worth pity.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0There\'92s a lot of unpleasantness that followed in these conversations. Details of a consensual blackmail fetish group tied into these zoosadists, details of acts committed by different torturers, details of who was involved and how they were involved. Things were starting to make sense, how Akela was involved, how Kero was involved, how SnakeThing was involved\'85 and the fact that there were torturers that weren\'92t released in the first leaks in September, ringleaders that had been scrubbed from the leaks. Now, I have to pause and say that at this point, a lot of information we were receiving was misdirection. But in receiving it from multiple directions, we were able to begin piecing together what was real and what wasn\'92t. That\'92s a slow, frustrating process \'96 made necessary because so many of the people we\'92re now talking to are absolutely unapologetic and occasionally pathological liars. Someone tells you the sky is blue, you stick your head out the window to double-check. That bad. Over and over and over. Despite that, we can winnow down some baseline facts, some reliably-imputed structure, some well-defined areas where we\'92re still lacking reliable knowledge, and a whole bunch of mostly-reliable, internally-consistent, best-estimate-from-known-facts inferences and deductions. There\'92s a picture: some areas sharp, some blurry. But it\'92s a picture. An ugly fucking picture.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Two things that were becoming consistent: one, Kero was being groomed by SnakeThing, likely since before he was a legal adult. Kero did participate in the sharing and consumption of torture videos, but he\'92d have moments of clarity where he\'92d be disgusted with himself and try to walk away, but he\'92d be back again the next day. Being groomed into this stuff is a soul-crushing process, and Kero was steeped in it for years. That he never ended up participating himself is noteworthy, given that information.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0As an aside, reading back through years of Kero\'92s logs and DMs, I can only say that we failed this young man as a community, first and foremost. He was so young when he showed up at BeastForum \'96 which, by the way, having 13 year olds in a porn forum maybe not such a fucking responsible decision, Beaker \'96 and nearly all the peer pressure he\'92s getting is to relax his ethics, not be so worried about a little violence, admit he likes the \'93hard stuff.\'94 What the fucking fuck. Seeing how that happened at BeastForum, I can only say that our worst suspicions of how noxious that forum had become don\'92t even come close to matching reality. Irrespective, the failure here is collective: this young man drifted deeper and deeper into a world of pure shit, and really nowhere along the way did anyone reach out and actually try to show a better path. Maybe everyone\'92s just too busy screaming about bullshit on twitter or whatever, but we all bear responsibility for an environment in which the most obvious place for a youngster to learn about our world is a noxious scamware site run by a drooling idiot hiding out in the UK. Back to number two: everyone we talked to was afraid of someone \'97 of Akela, of Shadowwoof, of each other, of \'93them,\'94 sometimes of Toggle and I. They all seemed to have leverage over each other. They all sought leverage over us, or claimed to have it already. Fucking leverage. Right now, I\'92d like to leverage this whole shitpile of broken souls into the ocean and pretend it never existed. Honestly. Fucking leverage.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0One thing to note is that when we approached this, we went very directly. It wasn\'92t about gaining leverage over people to blackmail them \'96 which, we realised, was a huge surprise to almost everyone in this. It was about saying, \'93Hey. Tell us what\'92s going on, or get the hell out of our way.\'94 And that seemed like a foreign language to these folks. No matter how much we\'92d simply say we\'92re looking to learn what happened and what\'92s happening now, most we talked to could not imagine any such thing. It was just a ruse, to try to get them to give us leverage. We\'92re trying to correct any errors in our little podcast, and like that we\'92re down a dark rabbit hole of blackmail, violence, lies, underage grooming, threats, and\'85 leverage, of course.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0So one particular person who\'92s been giving me a lot of information, he\'92s been acting a little suspicious. Just little things. I noticed at one point he stopped using periods when typing. \'93Oh, that\'92s weird,\'94 I said. \'93All your periods disappeared.\'94 \'93Stop being so paranoid!\'94 he said. Which was weird. I didn\'92t accuse him of anything. I just noticed his writing had changed a bit. Another, I answered his snarky question with \'93ok.\'94 Just \'93ok.\'94 He replies that I need to stop accusing everyone of being spies or sadists, if I want to have anyone talk to me. Huh? You got all that from \'93ok?\'94 These gruesome jumps were everywhere we turned, and you never know when you\'92ll ask a straightforward question and end up off in some parallel universe of lies and accusations as a direct result.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Just to jump in: another unsettling theme was that it seemed every time we stumbled upon something legitimate, the person we were talking to would be like, \'93Stop being paranoid.\'94 Fausty is a paranoid motherfucker. Clinically paranoid. It\'92s fair to call him paranoid. But when every single time you say it, what he\'92s paranoid about ends up being true, it\'92s alarming confirmation of that paranoia. You can\'92t excuse a fact by insisting that fausty is paranoid and that\'92s why he uncovered the fact. That\'92s just not how reality works. He may be paranoid\'85 heck as he\'92ll tell you himself, he is paranoid \'96 and for good reason, if you ask me \'96 but that doesn\'92t change whether water is wet or gravity works even in a vacuum. They\'92re totally unrelated issues. I have seen fausty called paranoid right after he told someone he\'92s paranoid \'96 and more than once! Times like that, you really do have to laugh despite the ugliness of all this.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Mostly I just tell people upfront: I\'92m normally suspicious and after what I\'92ve seen lately, I\'92m right up in full paranoid mode right now, so please don\'92t act surprised when I act suspicious. But it never works. We get into a talk, something doesn\'92t like up, I point that out, and \'93fuck you fausty, you paranoid fuck!\'94 Well sure ok\'85 but that still doesn\'92t line up. I dunno\'85 I wish I was imagining all this stuff, I really do. That\'92d be a much better world. With one guy, he\'92s lecturing me about how I don\'92t \'93get it\'94 and never will, and I\'92m asking him to explain \'93it,\'94 and he\'92s sort of dancing around and suggesting he can help\'85 but he doesn\'92t. And I\'92m sort of watching the clock, thinking \'93I could be doing literally anything but this right now\'85 why the hell and I talking to this tragically damaged human being I\'92ve never met and never will? And then he used the term \'93puppy splitter\'94 to describe one of the acts. Just out of the blue, like you might say \'93pipe cleaner\'94 or \'93estate planner.\'94 Puppy splitter. Horrific, just fucking horrific. And worse: it kind of sounded familiar. Where did I hear that before? So this guy seems particularly preoccupied with Rainstirs, asking for everything I know about him. That\'92s fine. I sent him an audio clip with details about it, only, out of paranoid habit, I changed a couple of details. Basically I said that I had helped hunt down Rainstirs and stop him (at least temporarily, unfortunately) from \'93cutting dogs open and fucking their entrails while they were still alive and screaming in pain.\'94 You know, the usual stuff \'96 just with \'93puppy\'94 changed to dog and one more change I prefer to keep private for future use. Stepping back, he started out by saying that he and Akela had been stalled for the past six months on their work, but later in the conversation, he said, \'93Well, you know, we\'92ve actually got this all under control, so don\'92t worry about it.\'94 Well, of course I\'92m worried about it. Animals are being tortured to death, and you\'92ve been sitting on your ass for six months, and now you\'92re trying to tell me it\'92s all under control? Bullshit. Also nobody has said a word about Rainstirs in all this yet. Nothing. I told the story only to demonstrate the absurdly awful things I\'92ve seen before, which yes Rainstirs, and suddenly someone\'92s echoing back details of Rainstirs\'92 evisceration techniques to me in perfect detail. Woah woah woah\'85 just fucking back this shit up a minute\'85\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Inserting another theme here. When we realized we were being misdirected, a common theme in that misdirection was, \'93Everything is under control. Just don\'92t do anything rash, or you could fuck everything up. We\'92ve got this.\'94\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Yes. Whenever things got awkward to the point of surreal, we\'92d fall into the \'93it\'92s all being handled, the details are secret, nothing to see here folks, move right along, these are not the torturers you are looking for\'94 black hole. So, in this convo, I tell him I have no intention of letting this go, and he starts demanding that I send him everything I have on Rainstirs. Rainstirs? Why Rainstirs. That was a decade ago. So I say, \'93OK, I\'92ll send you everything.\'94 And he\'92s like, \'93Good, good.\'94 \'93No, of course I\'92m not going to send you everything, you idiot.\'94 \'93Well, don\'92t you agree that he should be stopped?\'94 And then he proceeds to describe, in detail, the exact acts that Rainstirs committed, echoing back a puppy-based evisceration scenario\'85 and he also flips another little tidbit to the the way Rainstirs actually did things in his videos. So, right there, either you have watched all of Rainstirs videos amazingly closely (a disgusting job I\'92ve actually done but I hope few others have), or you are Rainstirs and you know how you did things in the videos. Neither of which lined up with who I was supposed to be talking to. Which, of course I\'92m paranoid, but I\'92m thinking the average person doesn\'92t just randomly switch \'93dog\'94 to \'93puppy\'94 in that wonderful little scene, when they repeat the unimaginably evil thing I\'92ve just told them in my voice message. Which\'85 I guess I\'92m paranoid for noticing that? When I pointed it out, he was like, \'93Oh, you know, I meant what you said before.\'94 \'93No, but you don\'92t understand. What you described by accident is exactly what Rainstirs did. Which means you\'92re either very familiar with Rainstirs\'92 videos, or you\'92re Rainstirs.\'94 And there was a pause. And he replied, \'93So what happens now?\'94 Well, I told him I had a PET scan that day, and it wasn\'92t good news. \'93How long you got,\'94 he asked. \'93Hard to say,\'94 I said. \'93I\'92m guessing maybe six months until I\'92m in the hospital. You think that\'92s enough time?\'94 \'93I don\'92t know,\'94 he said. \'93I do.\'94 He tells me that, oddly, he respects me \'96 I\'92m an ass, but he respects me. I tell him I can\'92t say the same about him, and he says he can certainly understand why. That happened, it really did. Now, this was in theory a chat with some furry kid who owns that account\'85 which yeah I guess maybe he just went haywire and said those things. I may be paranoid, but you\'92re gonna have to be one hell of a conspiracy theorist to explain how a random furry suddenly starts answering questions as Rainstirs. Because that\'92s what he was doing \'96 call it what you will, but that\'92s what it looks like.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0So Rainstirs, aka Tim Amaroso, reached out to us using a false account to find out what we knew about him. That\'92s what I\'92m seeing here. This was in a plaintext Telegram chat. Multiple folks can log into the same account in such chats and participate simultaneously in the same chat as the same account\'85\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Right, and later on when I pointed this out to Akela, he at first told me it couldn\'92t be done, then admitted maybe it could be done\'85 then told me that, go figure, he was logged into someone else\'92s Telegram account at the same time as them right then, as he was typing. So yes, I\'92m paranoid \'96 but you tell me if that\'92s the kind of thing you have happen on a daily basis. What are the chances, eh?\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Earlier in that conversation, someone said that he\'92d been a part of every zoosadism investigation squad from last September, which means he had access to all the information they had and was able to sabotage the work they were doing. Theoretically. If you\'92re paranoid.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Furthermore, there were two people talking through that fake account \'96 I pointed this out, and was told that he was \'93sometimes walking outside and typed differently on his phone.\'94 Ok, maybe\'85 but then later it was \'93I have carpal tunnel,\'94 which makes no sense whatsoever as an explanation. Tim \'96 assuming one of the two was Tim, talking at the end \'96 didn\'92t use the same grammar as the first person. Does that \'93prove\'94 anything? Well, add in the otherwise-inexplicable inclusion of Tim-specific evisceration details, and the later admission that yes these folks do login concurrently to each others\'92 Telegram accounts\'85 and you tell me: what\'92s your conclusion, eh? Proof? No. But Occam says it walks and talks and quacks like a fucking puppy torturer, maybe don\'92t trust it around puppies.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0So at this point, we\'92re coming to these conclusions: First, the logs that Akela released in September were only meant to ruin SnakeThing \'97 and ruin is in quotes here. Some other people got leaked in the meantime, and they were super pissed and have been sweeping themselves under the rug since. Second, Kero was brought in and being groomed by Nel \'97 SnakeThing, that is. But they didn\'92t trust him; he wasn\'92t a monster, but he had a lot of potentially damaging information. So they took him down and marked him as a zoosadist and neutralized him as a threat. Which worked brilliantly by the way. Who would listen to Kero now if he pointed out nearly-unimaginable horrors or whatever else he knows but can\'92t really make stick after this horrible lynching he suffered.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Third, these zoosadists joined all three investigation groups to misdirect and generate infighting within. All three groups melted down. Not entirely an accident. Fourth, the podcast picking this investigation back up and examining it was incredibly frustrating to the torturers left unpunished, who had apparently been breathing easy and felt their efforts had basically worked, which is why they started targeting us with misdirection and misinformation. Infiltrate, inject false \'93disclosures\'94 to us, create infighting, if possible. Misdirect our attention. We have seen exactly this pattern, in neon bright clarity. And the groups investigating this last year saw the exact same thing \'96 and fell apart thereafter.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0I\'92m sad to say that there was some infighting in our group. One thing that breaks down in this dark world is trust. Trust is so important for normal, healthy people, but it\'92s a liability when everyone you\'92re talking to is saying, \'93Trust me, it\'92s all OK,\'94 and lying through their teeth. Who can you trust? No one. Not even your friendly rat cohost, or other people involved I won\'92t name. No one can be trusted.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Yep, I did pull Toggle up one afternoon. Things were lining up in some uncomfortable coincidences. Too many to simply ignore. So I confronted him. Know what he didn\'92t do? He didn\'92t talk about leverage. He didn\'92t threaten me. He didn\'92t say \'93you can\'92t prove it.\'94 What did he do? He told me he was devastated by what I was saying, that he had no idea what to say, that he thought we were friends, and that this \'93suck so fucking much.\'94 All of that was absolutely true \'96 and all if it was painful, and damaging, and sad. And all if that was necessary because we\'92re dealing with a world where lies are absolutely the coin of the realm. I fucking hated doing that with Toggle. Disgusting. And I\'92m disgusted that I know how to do that, and that I can make myself do it. But I did \'96 because tortured puppies. And I told Toggle I hoped he\'92d forgive me someday, because tortured puppies. I told him I\'92d burn his friendship to protect myself from being sent off on a dead-end tangent, if necessary. I\'92d pay that price \'96 I\'92d pay just about any price. And I will. And that\'92s tragic. To get out of those deep, dark corners once the ugly testing is done, you have to kind of rely on a deeper kind of trust. No, I can\'92t trust that you\'92re not lying to me. I want to \'96 but I know you might be getting \'93leveraged\'94 right now and I can\'92t pretend that\'92s even unlikely in this shit-stained mess of a slice of humanity. But I trust that things will generally turn better, I trust that you, even if you\'92re lying to me, even if you\'92re involved in terrible things, can eventually make changes to be better. We\'92ve been in a very dark place for the past two weeks, and it does take a toll on relationships, even really close ones. We have one goal: we will stop these people from torturing animals at all costs. All costs. And that\'92s a destructive path to go down. Entirely necessary, but certainly unhealthy for any sort of relationship.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Now, don\'92t worry, folks, we\'92re fine. We mention this as part of being open and honest, and because it\'92s important in understanding where this shitty rabbit hole of animal torture can take you. It\'92s weird, and it\'92s foreign, and it\'92s dangerous. You walk that dark path because you have to, but you walk off it by retaining your honesty and dignity and integrity \'96 even when it\'92s dark all around. We\'92re talking about our own hard parts, here, because they happened and because that\'92s how we make sure we\'92re not going rotten at the core.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0At this point, we knew he had to talk to Kero, so we reached out to Akela to see if he had contact information.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Akela said something along the lines of, \'93I don\'92t know what you could possibly ask him that I couldn\'92t answer myself.\'94 \'93His perspective, mostly,\'94 I replied. Later that night, our DMs lit up with reports that Akela was instructing people not to talk to us, that he was pretty pissed about some logs that Shadowwoof sent us. And true, Shadowwoof just kept sending file after file after file.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0People allegedly affiliated with Akela started asking, \'93Hey, did someone send you a cache of logs?\'94 \'93I don\'92t know how to answer that question,\'94 I said. \'93Why do you ask?\'94 \'93Oh, you could potentially be hurting lots of innocent zoos with those logs!\'94 Rest assured, we\'92re not in the business of hurting innocent zoos, here. But there was another thing that kept coming up \'97 that the logs were being edited, that Akela had spent the last six months editing these logs. We\'92re pretty sure now that was disinformation, but it struck us as odd. Why the hell were people editing these logs so damn much? And what were they editing out? No way to tell. We know now they seemed to have scrubbed out any mention of Tim in the original leaks. How the hell would you know that, though? And you know what innocent zoo they didn\'92t edit out before? Kero. So spare me the bullshit about how we\'92re going to harm innocent zoos. Akela was becoming incredibly suspect, when previously we\'92d been happy to assume he was clean.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Obviously, the immediate course of action is to contact Akela and find out for ourselves if any of this was true or not.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Meanwhile, in the background, Zooier Than Thou was being DDOS\'92d, specifically the second episode which is on a different server. Wasn\'92t actually very effective, but noteworthy. I mean\'85 there\'92s been this sort of low-level background noise of pathetic skiddie stuff poking at our stuff since a few days after the podcast aired. You know what pisses me off about it? It\'92s the kindergarten-level competence it exhibits. That\'92s fucking insulting. I\'92m insulted by that.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Fausty gets insulted by\'85 unexpected things, sometimes. Call him a paranoid, obnoxious, clueless piece of shit and he\'92s likely to cheerfully agree. Point a twitter botnet at the CSA account to create fake traffic stats (which I have no idea the idea behind that), and he\'92s livid. A TWITTER BOTNET?\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0My favourite dynamic in this has been people contacting me to scream that I\'92m ignorant, incompetent, and I\'92m doing this all wrong. I agree, basically \'96 doing the best I can, but could be wrong and hell I don\'92t remember taking a class at MBA school on how to take down animal torture cults, sorry. And I ask what I should be doing to be less ignorant, more effective, less incompetent. And it\'92s either \'93nothing, it\'92s all being taken care of, these aren\'92t the torturers you\'92re looking for\'94 which sure Obi-Wan, nobody wants your cheesy rehash of Joseph Campbell\'92s mythological ethnography, or it\'92s \'93fuck you Fausty.\'94 Which I don\'92t think is a promise for future sex, so unfortunately mostly it seems to mean toys have been taken and someone\'92s going home. Not once \'96 not once \'96 has someone said \'93here\'92s how to stop being a dumb fuck and make this really work.\'94 Not. Fucking Once.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Ease down, big fella\'85 maybe they\'92ll just hurl ugly insults at you next, and you can relax. Anyway, next I messaged Akela at length, saying, \'93Hey, why are you telling people not to talk to us? Here\'92s what we think is going on, and we\'92re trying to just be perfectly honest in our approach in this. Everyone who we\'92ve talked to so far puts you right in the middle of this, so just talk to us yourself and help us figure out what\'92s really going on.\'94 And the first thing he says in reply: \'93So you figured out Tim is Rainstirs. I thought Fausty had taken care of him. Not so easy, is it?\'94 Which\'85 wow, OK. \'93And then he says, \'93Look, I\'92ve been watching you guys from the beginning. So you contact me now, why, because you think you have leverage? You don\'92t.\'94\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Leverage!\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Akela goes on to tell us he\'92s got the dox on Shadow, and that he\'92s gonna have a hard time for leaking documents tied to a federal investigation. He mentions something in describing what\'92s been going on that puts Fausty on notice. He says that Homeland Security is involved due to cross state lines pedophilia and child trafficking.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0(please look at this section and clean up) Now, I\'92ve spent about six years of my life in federal prison, and there\'92s not much to do in prison except for read and talk to people. I met a number of pedophiles behind bars, and I studied a good bit of law. I\'92ve looked into a lot of cases involving pedophilia, and all that studying suggests that Homeland Security has nothing to do with this stuff. Moreover, though, that\'92s exactly what the second person I was talking to said when I was talking to Tim. Given the exact phrasing, it seemed evident that Akela was the second person I was talking to. Paranoia? Maybe, but it lined up.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Akela basically said we didn\'92t know what the hell was going on, he\'92s been working on it for the past six months and we just didn\'92t know what work he\'92d been doing, we were being stupid and reckless, sure. These things mostly checked out. We wouldn\'92t have contacted him in the first place if these things weren\'92t true. He also made sure to tell us he wasn\'92t afraid of us, though we weren\'92t really coming from a place of intimidation, just of trying to figure out what the hell was going on. We were hoping we could get a hold of what exactly was misinformation and what was legit. Pretty much everyone we talked to said they were buddy-buddy with Akela, but also afraid of Akela. It was kind of hard for us to believe he was clean in all this, especially with Fausty being pretty certain he was that second person in the chat with Tim. Akela also dropped another interesting piece of information here: that Fausty\'92s friend EQ was somehow involved, that he was a ring leader in the whole thing.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0We\'92d seen EQ\'92s name before mentioned. EQ? Equinas? No, not the Equinas we know. Gotta be Equibooru. That makes more sense. I\'92d asked some other folks, even. \'93EQ, you know EQ? You think he\'92s wrapped up in this?\'94 \'93No, not Equinas. You\'92ve gotta be thinking of Equibooru.\'94 But no, Akela was pointing at someone I know personally. Now, granted, I hadn\'92t talked to EQ since maybe 2012. But it does tie into a conversation that one of our listeners had with Akela with regards to me last year. He mentioned me to Akela in the context of the book, and Akela told him that my inner friends circle included zoosadists. News to me, I\'92ll tell you that! But interestingly, Akela didn\'92t say which of my friends was a zoosadist. If he were just trying to spread rumors about EQ, why wouldn\'92t he have mentioned it back then?\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0There were a few details that stood out as troubling in our conversation with Akela. Unfortunately, because these things always happen concurrently, one of my family members ended up in the hospital, and I had to drop out at such a critical time. Akela was not thrilled when I pointed Akela to Doug and signed off for a little while.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0So the ball was in my court, with regards to Akela, so I called him, and we talked for six hours. (fill in the blanks)\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0By the time I came back, we had our hands on the unedited logs, and we had to kind of decide what the hell to do with them. Akela was a little difficult to press for more information, and several other people we were talking to were acting a little strange, like there was some kind of gag order with regards to some of the questions we were asking. Here, unfortunately, there are details we really need to leave out, even though it\'92s super critical into why we chose to release the logs, but what we eventually came to realize is that pretty much everyone we talked to were under duress, and there was something they were trying to get us to do but they couldn\'92t tell us. Because their accounts were all being watched. We knew for a fact Akela was logged in and watching other people\'92s accounts. And we knew that he had leverage on other people. And we suspected someone had leverage on him, too. We were also certain that people who contacted us and tried to misdirect us were very adamant that we not release the logs for one reason or another. We decided that the expedient release of the logs may help relieve some of the pressure.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0But this was not before looking over the logs and making sure what we had was as viable as possible. The logs had been formatted, so they weren\'92t the original telegram format. Not ideal. And they were organized by Akela, who ultimately decided how the information should be presented. Not ideal. There was one folder I decided to redact, helpfully labelled Kero, because of the stuff we knew \'97 and didn\'92t know \'97 about Kero. The other folder I worried over for a long time was Equinas. Akela had included it, but apart from a couple of notable things, there wasn\'92t really a lot in them that was damning. I spent several hours grilling our contacts about him. How was he connected? Every one of them said, \'93Oh, yeah, he\'92s definitely into hardzoo.\'94 But there wasn\'92t a lot more most of them could say. Akela was the most insistent, and had the most information, but couldn\'92t provide proof, and said there would never be any proof. \'93I can\'92t use any of this,\'94 I told him. \'93Give me something I can use.\'94 Any time I tried to pressure him into saying more, he\'92d say, \'93I\'92ve told you all that I can tell you.\'94 Meaning, there\'92s more, but he wasn\'92t at liberty to tell. Wonder why, eh? One big strike against EQ was his confirmed association with Tim \'97 Rainstirs \'97 and his unblinking interaction with zoosadism in the logs. There was also the matter of Derby. I trusted EQ enough to give him a dog named Derby. Two weeks later, I get a call from EQ like, \'93Hey, I\'92m sorry to tell you this, but Derby\'92s dead. Hit by a car.\'94 \'93Oh, my god, did you take her to the vet?\'94 \'93What? No, she\'92s dead.\'94 \'93Wow, well, how are you holding up?\'94 \'93Me? I\'92m fine. What do you mean?\'94 I chocked it up to shock at the time, but there was something that never quite sat right about that conversation with me, and now, with these accusations, and knowing EQ was friends with Tim at this time, Derby\'92s death seemed a lot less like an accident. In the end, I decided to leave the folder alone, and that wasn\'92t a decision I made lightly. I also looked over the logs and thought, \'93You know, this could all be fake, or it could be heavily edited. There\'92s really no way to know.\'94 Well, we were able to confirm the authenticity of at least some of the logs \'97 including EQ\'92s, after contacting him directly. There were a lot of non-ideal things happening here, including the pressure to release these logs as soon as possible. But we didn\'92t release them without careful consideration.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0And then there they were. We created several redundancies, pulled in contacts from the intelligence community, pulled in Anons \'97 not the 4chan turds playing sociopath online, real Anons \'97 and got law enforcement officers on the case. After they were released, informants came forward to help us identify people in the logs, and we\'92re actively tying user names to identities. Also, Fausty is on twitter acting like an absolute, Grade-A asshole.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0True. If you\'92ve only been watching this unfold on twitter, I can understand how you\'92d look at this and say, \'93Wow, that reckless motherfucker is grandstanding and trying to ride on the back of this to\'85\'94 I don\'92t actually know how doing this helps my popularity in any way. Doesn\'92t matter. That\'92s not actually the point. I want these torturers to know that we have their number. I want them to be scared. I want them to scrub their chat logs and put their severed puppy ears through the shredder and clean the blood from the bedroom floor. Because every second they\'92re running scared, looking behind their backs, trying to clean up the evidence, they\'92re not torturing and killing animals. Maybe that\'92s a shitty tactic, but it buys us time where we know Tim isn\'92t splitting puppies open because he\'92s too busy hiding. And with EQ, always careful, never leaving behind a trace, confident that he can\'92t get caught, we want to send a message to those who think they\'92re too smart to get in trouble that we\'92ve got their number, too. The heat is on, and we want you to feel it. As long as these scumbags feel safe, they\'92re going to keep torturing animals, and fuck letting them feel so complacent. You think you can actually hide? You think these guys won\'92t start talking the second law enforcement puts the screws to them? Hope you haven\'92t been hanging out with Tim, because I guarantee he\'92s gonna squeal.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0And if you\'92re thinking, \'93Oh, maybe I\'92ll just make sure Tim can\'92t talk for good,\'94 well, now you\'92re getting sloppy. Turns out the law is a bit more stringent when it comes to murdering humans. Maybe you think you can get away with it. Is that worth that calculated risk? They\'92re gonna catch you eventually, and then you\'92ve got first degree murder on your rap sheet. No matter how you play this, you\'92re fucked. So tighten up your opsec, go underground, cancel your meet-ups and take down your torture porn servers. Feel free to delay the inevitable, but you\'92d better not fuck up. One slip up, one stray puppy limb unchecked, and you\'92re gonna get what you deserve. Every time you get the urge, I want you to think to yourself, \'93Is someone watching me right now? Did Fausty send a drone over to my barn and set up surveillance cameras?\'94\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0I\'92ve actually priced this out. If you\'92re not legitimately afraid of that possibility, you\'92re crazy.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Rest assured, it\'92s not just a rat and a dog poking at this anymore. And it\'92s not just the zoo community. And it\'92s not furries, fuck no. This is so much bigger. This is US intelligence, this is US law enforcement, this is the full brunt of the internet\'92s top hackers, and they\'92re about to all drop on your head.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0A side note for those of you worrying right now because you were being groomed into this monstrous shit: we\'92re not after you. You\'92re victims in this. If you haven\'92t actually hurt an animal, you\'92re a bit too small fry for our investigation. But god help you if you ever do hurt an animal. We said this to so many people throughout this process: This is not a game. This is life and death. We\'92re risking our lives to save the lives of our four-legged friends.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0And let me also add one more thing: we truly love you for listening to our podcast. But this isn\'92t about scoring brownie points and clout. We don\'92t give a shit about whether this makes us look good or bad, or whether we have more followers or subscribers \'97 except for how that effects the reach of this information. All of that stuff is trivial. I\'92ll say it again. This isn\'92t a game. This is life and death. This is the right thing to do, no matter the personal consequences are. And hey, if we\'92re doing this all wrong, we\'92re happy to hear suggestions on how to do this right, as long as those suggestions don\'92t include, \'93Don\'92t do anything. Just leave this alone and let someone else take care of it.\'94 Sure, you didn\'92t know this, but that\'92s essentially what every disinformant that contacted us to misdirect us told us to do, including Rainstirs himself. It\'92s not an option. Help us do this work better, not pawn it off on someone else.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Let me also address another false concern, that releasing this information somehow hinders law enforcement in nailing these guys. Listen, we\'92re actively talking with law enforcement officials right now, and not one, not one of them has told us, \'93Hey, guys, you really need to take this stuff down because it\'92s going to ruin our investigation.\'94 Zero. So don\'92t give us that bullshit.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Another thing you don\'92t know is how much outside, non-zoo help we were able to get by releasing these logs. People care about protecting animals, and you can\'92t really imagine this kind of stuff exists without reading these logs for yourself. Everyone I\'92ve showed these logs to in my non-zoo life has said, \'93Holy shit, how the fuck can I help?\'94 The natural reaction is to help take these guys down. We would love for our listeners to help in any way that they can.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0This is still ongoing, but this is hopefully the last time we have to talk at length about it on the podcast.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Our next episode will return to our more whimsical format, because being serious zoo all the damn time is fucking exhausting. Sorry to those who asked us not to do comedy anymore. We\'92ve already written out the sketches.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Thanks for sticking with us through this trying time. Be nice to each other. It\'92s the sexiest, zooiest thing you can do.\

\f0\b \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 \'a0Never forget to stay defiant, fellow zoos! We\'92ll see you next time you feel like howling at the moon!\
