\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Greetings, my friends and fellow zoos, and welcome to another uplifting episode of the zooiest of zooey podcasts, Zooier Than Thou. I\'92m Fausty, a grey-muzzle zoo adding my oldster perspectives to the podcast\'85\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And this is Toggle. Don\'92t mind me, I\'92m just cloud-surfing behind this plane like Kit Cloudkicker.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0We have the honor of serving as your co-hosts for this episode of Zooier Than Thou!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I don\'92t know about you, Fausty, but I\'92m still feeling that zoo pride high from earlier this month!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Indeed, indeed. Speaking of zoo pride, it\'92s really been something to see how all the other zoo podcasts celebrated. Of particular note, Zoostradamus\'92s podcast made some very favorable predictions about the health of the zoo community in the coming future. Given their history of making impressively-accurate predictions, let\'92s hope this one comes true, eh?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Radio Dog Lovers went a bit more\'a0avant-garde\'a0and just played a solid hour of dogs barking over downtempo beats, which was interesting.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0They\'92re always one step ahead of the game, if I\'92m being perfectly honest. We\'92re nowhere near cool enough to pull off a stunt like that \'96 obviously \'96 though I must say RDL made it work and made it work with their usual panache and fashionable\'a0je ne sais quois.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yeah, it was surprisingly listenable.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And our colleagues over at the venerable Zootopia podcast\'85\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Zoo Utopia. They had to change it, remember?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Right, sorry. There\'92s some blurry bits of the spring months, on account of some of my cancer treatment, and from time to time I lose data points\'85\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0About Zoo Utopia?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Ah, right! So, Zoo Utopia actually covered the Zoo Pride Parade over in Pittsburgh live! I wasn\'92t able to attend -cancer \'96 though I heard from friends that it was quite the shindig.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0They actually had a lot more attendees than the Straight Pride parade in Seattle a few years back.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That\'92s actually not saying much. Whatever the case, it was a real treat to listen to the live coverage, realtime.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Needless to say, we\'92re visibly swollen with pride here at Zooier Than Thou, and it seems some of our listeners felt the same! After our episode aired, we got a couple more audio submissions, and so we thought we\'92d play them for you now!\
(Cue Audio Submissions)\
\'93I admit I was a little skeptical at the concept of zoo pride. I guess I thought that it might be some kind of shameless self-promotion. While I\'92m not really interested in self-promotion, I am shameless. And I think that if the culmination of all this is that zoosexuality becomes ubiquitous and otherwise unremarkable in the context of someone\'92s whole other life, it\'92s a really good thing, and I\'92m happy to be a part of it.\'94\
\'93For me, zoo pride is beyond just being proud of yourself, or being who you are, being able to stand up to anyone who will judge you for that. It\'92s also the ability of being proud of the relationships that you can form with animals, the ability to treat them as people.\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Speaking personally, I have been deeply touched by many of the listener submissions on the topic of zoo pride. In addition to the wonderful diversity of views on what zoo pride means to each of is, the overall zeitgeist of the community \'96 the pride in our pride, as it were \'96 comes through in each and every one of those submissions. Bravo, fellow zoos!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Without further ado, let\'92s dive into this episode\'92s late-arriving batch of zoo pride submissions. First up, here\'92s a zoo pride submission from Our Friendly Neighborhood Zoosexual. Subject: \'93Hey I think I might be late so if that\'92s the case sorry and do whatever you like!\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What we\'92d most like to do, Friendly, is share your comments so off we go!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Friendly writes: \'93What does Zoo Pride mean to me?\
\'93For me zoo pride means never having to be ashamed of who I am, that the sexuality that I just happen to have makes me neither hero nor monster, but instead it\'92s our actions that make us who we actually are. Zoo pride means allowing myself to live to my fullest potential even if there are those who may hate and fear us for existing; the hope that greater things will come; and most important of all, the celebration of all the wonderful nonhuman relationships in my life this far, whether they were platonic or otherwise!\
\'93As for the zoo pride day/week which until just a little while ago, I didn\'92t even know was even a thing, that is until I started listing to your show (thanks for that BTW) Zoo pride day/week also reminds me that we may have a long ways to go, but its things such as this show where people can hear from zoos who are actually decent people, that\'92s what bring us a whisker closer.\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0We certainly hope it\'92s a hair more than a whisker, Friendly, though we certainly agree that there\'92s much work yet to be done and many challenges yet in store. Your focus on living to our fullest potential certainly resonates with me, and it\'92s great to hear that you are also seeing this as a central element of our pride in ourselves.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Friendly continues: \'93Also speaking of your show I think both of your humor is spot on, and poor Toggle totally sounds like he\'92s got balls, lol!\'94 See, even the listeners know that rat balls are massive and that they drop during times of arousal or dominance.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0You must not feel very dominant, then, cuz those balls, they haven\'92t dropped yet. I\'92m not talking hypothetically, mind you: sitting here, right now, I can see (since, like so many rats for whatever reason, Toggle wears this weird-assed outfit that covers his top half but leaves his boy-parts visible for all the world to see\'85 if he had boy-parts, that is, which I\'92m not quite sure to be honest. Never seen \'91em, not even once.)\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Fausty\'92s just jealous because I don\'92t have to worry about sitting on my balls all the time.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I\'92m more than happy to work around the management issues involved in having actual testicles, actually, for a whole host of reasons. One of which is, frankly, that it\'92s a hell of a lot better than sounding like some kind of Mickey Mouse motherfucker.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Don\'92t make me reach over there and rip that Prince Albert right out of your cock!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Whoa, hey now! No need for violence! Someday perhaps you\'92ll manifest balls, and then you\'92ll understand what you\'92ve been missing thus far. Patience, patience\'85\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Haha, one of these days, you\'92ll see. You\'92ll wake up and think, \'93These aren\'92t my glasses.\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0The elk does that even mean?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Don\'92t worry, there\'92s a furry out there laughing right now, and that\'92s good enough for me.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh heavens \'96 furry in-jokes\'85 I shouldn\'92t be surprised! Do you have more to share from that letter, Mr. Rat?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Ah, yes, it concludes: \'93Thank you for putting on this show! I know right now it\'92s just a grain of sand on a whole beach of other more main stream zoo podcasts but I think your day will come!\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0We like to think that, on the great beach that is the universe of zoo podcasts, Zooier Than Thou is a beautiful little shell: sure, we\'92re on the fringe, but our fringe existence is 100% pure fabulous!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Thanks so much, Friendly Neighborhood Zoosexual! Stay proud, and Stay defiant!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Who\'92s next, Toggle?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That would be this heartwarming letter from Canis Gnosis, who wants to say Thank You! Canis writes: \'93Howdy there, fellow zoos!\
Firstly, I\'92d like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.\
\'93Between the fragmentation and disillusionment of our community, the constant witch-hunts, and having lost my canine partner some years back, my own mental health (much less any sense of pride in myself) had been worn down to the quick. About two weeks ago (as of this writing) some anti-zoo shit-storming over on Twitter had done a number on my state of mind, pushing me to seek out something\'96anything\'96zoo-related and positive left on the internet\'85 And that\'92s when I stumbled across Zooier Than Thou.\
\'93I cannot fully put into words the difference I feel now. Not only is you guys\'92 podcast positive, it\'92s optimistic! Let\'92s just say that ZooTT and I are on the same page when it comes to opinions on morality, visibility, and zoophilia\'92s place in the world. I haven\'92t felt anywhere this much pride in who I am or my community in a very long time. A long-lasting bout of depression I had been struggling with has broken, and my spirits are as high now as when I first joined the online zeta community almost twenty years ago.\
\'93Zooier Than Thou has got me seriously thinking on ways I can help out with the cause of zoosexual rights and positive visibility. I\'92ve already circulated the tapes\'96as it were\'96to all my zooey and zooish friends online who seemed just as hungry for this kind of content as I was. There are a plethora of zetas within both the Furry and Other-kin communities, either closeted, self-hating or just with their head\'92s down, who desperately need to hear a self-affirming, pro-zoosexual voice. They just need to hear it.\
\'93It\'92s amazing what a little pride, and hope for the future can do for someone. Thank you again <3\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Toggle and I were talking about the podcast recently, in the context of my health challenges (which is to say, cancer), and I can say that the work we\'92ve done on the podcast since its launch earlier this year has been a high point for me on so many levels. It\'92s been an honor to be part of this project, More, it\'92s reinforced for me the value of positive, forward-looking approaches to community questions and that\'92s helped me through some tough times, like dealing with chemo-related ugliness during the past few months. Knowing that our work, in turn, helps others is just the sort of virtuous feedback loop we all hope to be part of.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0When I first read this letter, it made me feel so happy I just had to share it on Twitter. Every now and then, we get messages like these that affirm that we\'92re doing the right thing by putting together this podcast. I\'92ve never worked on anything that gave me such a sense of goodness and purpose like Zooier Than Thou. If we make the life of even one animal or one zoo better, then every moment we pour into this is worth it. Hearing this sort of thing gives me strength to persevere. Thanks, Canis Gnosis. You really did make my day with your e-mail. I\'92m so glad that we could have a positive impact on your life.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0We had a few more e-mails come our way, but we\'92re gonna hold onto them until the New Moon episode for now. Even if we haven\'92t responded yet, we do read every e-mail that comes across our desk, and we do respect when messages are marked as private, so don\'92t hesitate to send your thoughts along. Even though it\'92s a wonderful problem to have, by now we could easily fill each episode with nothing but submissions from listeners \'96 and there\'92s more to share than just these wonderful messages, so we\'92ll keep doing our best to highlight those that resonate most strongly.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Alright, Fausty, what\'92s today\'92s primary focus?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0This episode, we\'92re exploring the various ways in which today\'92s zoos have chosen to build our lives \'96 and in doing so we\'92ve been reminded of just how diverse, creative, and flexible zoos are when it comes to structuring our life paths and integrating our zooish identities with the rest of our most important attributes. There\'92s no one right way to \'93be zoo\'94 \'96 indeed, take 100 zoos and we\'92ll have 100 different and complimentary ways of being zoos. Whilst there\'92s some things about us that do bind us together into a community \'96 our respect for our nonhuman peers, or empathy, our ability to build deep relationships beyond the confines of human existence \'96 those commonalities exist alongside the wondrous diversity of zooish experiences and zooish living arrangements. This episode, we turn our focus to that diversity and to the wisdom to be found in learning from how others have crafted their own zoo lives.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Coming up next, a word from our sponsors, then an interview with a zoo-exclusive zoo, Yankee Doodle Donkey!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Don\'92t change that dial\'85 err, these newfangled podcast-y things don\'92t have dials, do they? Anyhow don\'92t change the controls of your podcast player, and we\'92ll be right back with more zooey good times.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle Soldier:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Hey, this seat taken?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Naw, have a seat. You must be new \'91round here.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle Soldier:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Heh, yeah. Thanks.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0My, they\'92re sure conscripting soldiers younger and younger these days. Pretty sure this kids balls haven\'92t even dropped.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle Soldier:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Hey! I\'92m old enough to kick your ass!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Relax, kid, he\'92s just teasin\'92 ya. Sit down, have a bite to eat. We\'92ve got a long way to go tomorrow.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Hey, so, ya\'92ll have been here for a while, right?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0You could say that. Seen countless battles, and still not dead yet.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0So, what\'92s the deal with the king?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Ha, you\'92re gonna have to be more specific, kid. King Alexander has a number of\'85 charming eccentricities, shall we say.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I just noticed, he\'85 seems to have a way with horses. Or, a specific horse, really. And a pretty specific way!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0You mean his boyfriend Bucephalus?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0B-boyfriend?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh, yeah, those two are a total power couple. Practically inseparable. Nothing quite like the bond between a Macedonian man and his horse. But they\'92re on a whole \'91nother level.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yeah, I couldn\'92t help but notice the way they\'85 interact with one another. Hand-in-glove, you might say\'85\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Kid, you don\'92t know the half of it.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0They say old Bucephalus was completely untamable. He\'92s a beauty of a fella, though, ain\'92t he? But when the merchant brought him to King Philip, no one could tame that handsome, big brute. Philip was going to turn the merchant away, but the stallion caught our Prince Alexander\'92s eye, and he proposed that if he could tame the horse, his father must purchase him at once.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yikes, King Alexander does seem to have quite an intimidating presence. I imagine he completely dominated the big beast.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Solder 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Hardly. He was only 10 years old.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Really? How did he dominate such a powerful horse, then?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0He stood and observed him quietly, and then noticed that the horse was particularly sensitive to moving shadows. So, when Prince Alex approached Bucephalus, he did so aware of the play of shadows and how those shadows would appear to the skittish horse. Just like that, Alex was able to earn Bucephalus\'92 trust and from there he was riding the stallion shortly thereafter.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Wow, that seems so simple.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Simple if you speak horse, maybe. All the other men tried to force their will on the stallion, but Alex alone thought to listen to the animal and work with him on his terms. Pretty impressive for a 10 year old kid.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Now they\'92re butt buddies. Only, it\'92s hard to tell who\'92s on top, since both of them are such dominant assholes.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0You really think so?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Kid, I don\'92t know if you\'92ve noticed, but King Alexander fucks just about anyone who catches his eye, man or woman. You really think it\'92s so farfetched that he\'92s fuckin\'92 his horse \'96 or the other way, or both at once, who knows!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Wow, I guess\'85 that\'92s not so farfetched. I\'92ve certainly never seen a horse so devoted to a man before like that.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Or a man so entirely devoted to a horse.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh, man, kid, you weren\'92t here when his horse got kidnapped.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Kidnapped?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh, yeah, so get this. As King Alex moved us forward on a campaign, Bucephalus was entrusted to staff so as to give him a rest from his duties as a battle steed. Coming up behind the front lines, the group that was caring for Bucephalus was beset by mountain bandits lookin\'92 to score some treasure. Once they realized that they had actually captured King Alex\'92s beloved stallion, they immediately let it be known that they would return the horse to Alex upon payment of a ransom.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh dear, I can\'92t imagine that went well for them.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0About as well as it could go. Most generals wouldn\'92t have thought twice about a horse. Lose a horse, get another one.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0But not King Alex and his Bucephalus. Oh, the king was fuckin\'92 furious! It wasn\'92t a matter of pride or ego, neither. He was just worried sick about the safety of his horse boyfriend. So the king laid it out for them: unless Bucephalus was returned to him, safe and sound, immediately Alexander would personally lead his army into the mountains, where he would kill every man, woman, and child of the hill tribes responsible for abducting his beloved \'96 no exceptions, no mercy.\

\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Holy shit!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And you know he\'92d do it, too. Over a fucking horse, no less\'85 a fucking horse who fucks like only a horse can fuck, right?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well, these guys were so spooked by his threats that they brought Bucephalus back to King Alexander immediately.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Wow, I imagined he killed the shit out of them.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0You\'92d think. No, he treated them with honour, and he actually paid their fucking ransom. Just so happy to have his boyfriend back. Imagine the great King Alexander, with his white-hot, bloodthirsty fury, feeling so damned relieved that instead of offing them, he showed mercy and gratitude.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That\'92s\'85 actually pretty strange.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Not when you consider how much he fuckin\'92 loves that horse. I\'92m tellin\'92 ya, kid. Those two are a total power couple.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0So, everyone\'92s just\'85 OK with the king ummm\'85 dating a horse?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Are you going to go up to the great King Alexander the conquerer and tell him that fucking a horse grosses you out?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Gosh, I guess not.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0It\'92s not really a big deal. He\'92s conquering the world in the name of Macedonia. No one really cares who he fucks. And he\'92s fuckin\'92 everyone out here. He likes him his handsome young men, too, so watch yourself, kid.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0(blushes)\'a0Oh, well, you know, I don\'92t mind so much about that. I guess I don\'92t really care about the horse, either. I just thought it was kind of strange and remarkable.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Solder 2:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0If you don\'92t eat your food, someone else is gonna eat it for you.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Soldier 1:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yeah, less talk, more chow. We\'92ve got a lot to do tomorrow, and you\'92re gonna need everything you have. You ain\'92t got no big brave stallion standing behind you, ready to save your ass when it\'92s needed, and service it when you\'92re needy, so you best get your shit together like the rest of us mere mortals and stop daydreaming about King Alex and Bucephalus and what they\'92re probably doing right this very moment in the general\'92s camp.\

\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Welcome back to another, exotic, erotic, egregious episode of Ask Zooey, the go-to cross-species sex advice show for the zoo\'92s who & even a few others, to boot! I\'92m your Great Dane with a great mane \'96 yes, ladies, these locks are real! \'96 Zooey!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And I\'92m the rat whose googles joggle when he\'92s boggled, Toggle!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0We\'92re so excited that you\'92re back for our fifth episode working with Zooier Than Thou! After the last episode, we got a flood of human submissions that we\'92re really excited to tackle! Remember, folks, you can send submissions through the form at zoo.wtf, or \'96 if you swing that way \'96 contact us through our twitter account @AskZooey, that\'92s A-S-K-Z-O-O-E-Y.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That poor account seems a little neglected, Zooey.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Honey, it\'92s all about keeping atop what comes first and twitter serves me, not the other way around. Well ok\'85 I\'92ll own up to being a bit less than obsessed with twitter-tastic efforts at outreach and I know we can do better. So let me encourage everyone to send in even your simplest questions on twitter \'96 I\'92ll find time in the day\'92s adventures to share a thought or two when it counts.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Alright, up first, we have a big question from Unsure in the UK.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I do so love a British accent, so honey, before we go one step further, you feel free to call me any-time, mmm?\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Unsure writes, \'93My boyfriend and I have a very comfortable relationship. We\'92ve been dating for a number of years, and as much as I love taking his massive, canine cock, sometimes I want to be on top, but I\'92m not sure how to approach this question with him, to make sure it\'92s something he\'92s comfortable with. Beyond that, I\'92m also not sure how to even go about it if he says yes. In short, Zooey, I wonder if you could explain how to have mutually enjoyable, consensual anal sex with my beloved companion.\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What a question. I think it\'92s safe to say this question is on a lot of people\'92s minds. Safe, consensual, and mutually enjoyable are definitely the key words \'96 as always! Pushing a bit deeper into the subject, handsome, let\'92s take a closer look at some of the brass-tacks details.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:\'a0
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Before we get into the tacks, brass or otherwise, let\'92s step back and remind ourselves off the bat is that sex \'96 all forms of intimacy,\'a0including\'a0sex \'96 requires trust, and listening, and understanding, and care. As to the tacks in question, here\'92s where things get specific: it\'92s a simple, sexy fact that not everyone \'96 of whatever species \'96 is going to be interested in anal sex. Straight-up, it goes without saying (though we\'92re saying it, just to be triple-clear) that respecting those boundaries is absolutely the first and second and third inviolate rule when it comes to such matters. No exceptions, no hesitation, no prevarication: no means no, and that\'92s an answer that isn\'92t subject to debate.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0First, second, third, AND fourth \'96 that rule rules the roost, just as dear little Toggle says in that sexy squeaky voice of his! That bottom-level basic premise set solidly in stone, let\'92s get into some of those sharp brass points of truth, when it comes to things related to bottoms\'85 it should come as no surprise to you, if you\'92re a gay man, that making sure things are clean is a must. However, no douching. A simple walk in the park should really do the trick. And another no-brainer as a male familiar with anal sex, you\'92re going to want to use lots of lube. Our experts don\'92t recommend condoms, simply because they can be a little uncomfortable for the receptive party, but if you feel condoms are necessary, more lube is necessitated as well.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0If you plan to play with fingers, mind your nails and claws, folks. Personally, as a rat, I don\'92t like fingers in my butt for precisely this reason. Your partner\'92s rumps are soft and sensitive, so it\'92s incredibly important to be mindful of your callouses and nails.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Actual entry requires gentle coaxing \'96 after she or he has let you know in no uncertain terms that it\'92s a green-light to sink a bit deeper into the topic. Your partner does need to be relaxed, which, again, as a male who\'92s had things stroked passionately into his all-but-begging butt, you should be aware of. Orgasms are actually great for this \'97 an orgasming boy of\'a0any\'a0species naturally clenches and relaxes his sphincter rhythmically. Timing is very important for this technique of entry, but it\'92s almost inevitable that you\'92ll be able to slide in. This technique works with the ladies, as well, so long as she\'92s relaxed enough and she\'92s not so full of spunk that she ends up wiggling away from things in her ecstasy.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Apart from catching things mid-orgasm, if you help your booty-begging boy to relax, and you\'92re\'a0very\'a0gentle and persistent and generous with the lube, you can apply a little bit of pressure to help him ease onto your cock. Slow and steady, and remember to\'a0pay attention to your partner.\'a0As always, even if he or she has said yes to entering, they can change their mind at any time: you, it goes without saying but we\'92re saying it anyway just to be triple-sure, will always and forever respect that.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh honey\'85 this\'a0really\'a0is an activity that requires trust, and you\'a0can\'a0very well lose that trust if you don\'92t absolutely and immediately respect your partner\'92s desires. One of our experts confessed that in a moment of heated passion, they lost that trust with their partner permanently, even after years of mutually enjoyable penetrative sex. It only takes one moment, so consider this when you and your partner are deciding what sexual activities work best for your relationship. Is the potential orgasm worth the risk of losing a deep trusting bond you\'92ve fostered over years of your relationship? Not everything\'92s about sticking that thing someplace and moving about until things get sticky: there\'92s so much more, and so much on the line when you take trust in your hands\'85 or in other parts of your anatomy, in shared pleasures like this.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Always, always,\'a0always! listen to your partner; not just their voice, but their entire body, at all times. Some partners \'96 mostly of the two-legged persuasion \'96 may have a cultural taboo when it comes to the concept of \'93anal sex\'94 \'96 but that\'92s not universal amoungst everyone, and it\'92s certainly not as common when we move outside the tight bubble of human expectations. For lots of folks, what\'92s first and foremost is finding and sharing intimate physical activities that bring loving partners closer to each other: physically, yes, and also emotionally and spiritually. For the more\'85 open-minded of our peers \'96 however many legs they may have carrying them along the path of life \'96 the measure of what\'92s a welcome addition to sex is whether it\'92s good for everyone involved: feels good, and also feels safe and closeness-encouraging for catchers & pitchers alike. Don\'92t assume that, just because some humans think \'93anal sex\'94 is some big taboo that exists merely to be transgressed or challenged, somehow everyone feels that way! Not at all, not at all \'96 that depends on your partner, and to answer that question\'a0you\'a0must be good at listening and respecting what they are saying, however they choose to say it!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That was a fantastic question,\'a0Unsure. I hope this helps you and your partner decide what\'92s best for you! It\'92s really no different from any other sort of sexy good fun shared between the two of you: respect and consideration and listening and caring aren\'92t unique to anal sex, or to any kind of sex\'85 or hell to sex at all! Stick with those basics, and\'a0wherever\'a0you two frisky folks are thinking about sticking things, you\'92ll cum out the other end with smiles all around! And, with that, here\'92s our next question from\'a0Is She Interested\'a0in Indiana: \'93Dear Zooey: I volunteer at a place with an absolutely gorgeous mule. I have a huge crush on her, but she sends me mixed signals. Sometimes, she\'92ll just ignore me when I groom or pet her, but other times she will go right up to my chest and nuzzle me. Also, whenever I walk her back to the paddock, she\'92ll pee while looking back at me, and then wink while she walks away. Do you think she wants to be more than just co-workers?\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh, boy, this right here is a classic love story in the making!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0For those listening at home, we cheerfully confirm that, noooope, winking has\'a0nothing\'a0to do with batting an eyelash in a four-hooved lady like this.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0So the big question: Is she interested? Mules in general tend to have a certain inbuilt proclivity to gravitate towards humans, whether the interest is Platonic or perhaps a bit more. From what you\'92ve told us in your note,\'a0Unsure, we both think it\'92s clear that she likes you: after all, she\'92s quite clearly showing you affection. The real question is whether or not your more-than-Platonic turn of thought is to go requited or not. As to that, wooing her is quite simple: no more and no less, it\'92s all about sharing with her your extra time. Spend a little longer grooming her. Show her that you care. And most importantly, show her your intent. She may be ignoring you when you groom her because you haven\'92t been stallion enough to let her know you\'92re interested. Though, I have to wonder if you haven\'92t already made your move, since she\'92s giving you a wink. She\'92s talking, you\'92re listening\'85 that\'92s\'a0always\'a0the right place to start!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0For those of you who are equine-illiterate, an amorous mare \'96 whether horse or mule \'96 will flex her vulva for potential suitors when she\'92s feeling the heat (whether in actual estrus or simply happy to receive carnal attentions at that point in time). This is called winking.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0When spending time together, pay attention to how she reacts to you. If she\'92s comfortable with you being near her hindquarters, and she\'92s raising her tail for you, those generally are ways for her to let you know that she sees you as a potential mate. If she pulls away or shows signs of discomfort at your advances, sorry big boy but \'96 for now \'96 you\'92re barking up the no-tree of polite refusal. Mules are proud, intelligent, and willful. She will absolutely let you know her intentions: basically, if and when things have moved a bit further and you show her yours, don\'92t be surprised when she shows you whether things are all-ahead-go or nope-not-now-fella.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Thanks so much for showing us that you\'92re\'a0Interested. In our humble opinions, it does sound like your crush is likely already returned in kind by that big girl, and we wish you the best of luck if the two of you decide to go ahead and take that relationship to the next level! A wink like that is nothing to scoff at\'85 oh no, not even a hint of a scoff.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Our last question for the evening comes from\'a0I\'92ll Be In the Lab\'a0in Livermore.\'a0In the Lab\'a0writes: \'93Dear Zooey: My aunt has a beautiful chocolate lab who I\'92ve been taking care of since we were both just wee young pups. As we grew up together, our love blossomed deeper and deeper, and eventually, we took things to the next level. She\'92s truly amazing, and our sex together is just so spectacularly, consistently mutually satisfying. Despite all that, I find myself wracked with guilt after each encounter, since \'96 well, in raw words, she\'a0belongs\'a0to my aunt. For all the usual reasons, I haven\'92t told my aunt about our secret trysts, since basically I worry she wouldn\'92t approve even though I don\'92t really know or not. My girl and I are madly in love, everything about our time together is just so great for both of us, but\'85 should I really keep our relationship going, or should I put an end to it since she belongs to another?\'94\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0With this question,\'a0In the Lab\'a0has oh-so-gently stroked a very hot-button issue in the zoo community. Right upfront, all of us here feel like we know the answer we\'92re\'a0supposed\'a0to give, buuuuut\'85 after talking about it with all the zoos on staff \'91round here, we feel this question calls on us to dive a bit deeper, try a bit harder, expect more than the standard \'93wham, bam, thank you ma\'92am\'94 kind of reply.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0First off, I am going to say that it\'92s very hard \'96 pretty much impossible, if we\'92re going to stay honest and stay legit \'96 for any of us at Ask Zooey, heck even anyone at Zooier Than Thou, to get up on our high horse (up\'a0on, not up\'a0in\'85 geez!) and preach hypocritically that someone can only be in a relationship with someone four-legged whom they legally \'93own.\'94 My first zooey experiences were with a relative\'92s dog \'96 nobody I owned, at the time or at any time thereafter. Straight-up clandestine rendezvous-level shit, yep. Fausty and Kyon both had their sexual awakening with a neighbor\'92s dog \'96 and they\'92ve both been upfront and honest about that in public for ages, and stood by those honest recollections. Not only are we not an unusual sample from amoungst zoos out there, but really we\'92re about as typical as the typical zoo gets in that regard; those who came of age with someone they \'93owned\'94 are in a very small minority of zoos out there, and that\'92s simply empirical fact \'96 no judgment, no ethical conclusion, just a fact to set the stage. As such, courting animals that don\'92t \'93belong\'94 to us is absolutely a very typical \'96 perhaps the single-most typical \'96 part of coming of age physically and personally as a zoo. Sooo, I think that when we get into this semantic space, we\'92re reckoning with two very different judgment-deriving systems that are in such situations nearly always at odds with one another: on the one paw, we\'92ve got the zooey morality which recognizes animals as autonomous individuals with the right to choose their own partners for their own reasons on their own terms with no role for a slave-style \'93owner\'94 stepping in to decide who gets to lick or mount whom and when. And then, on the other paw we\'92ve got the mundane legal system of judgment that governs animals as no more and no less than pure personal property. When it comes to zoos and the vagaries of youthful zoo \'93dating,\'94 those two systems are rarely going to agree on what\'92s right and what\'92s not. Again, that\'92s a simple fact and it\'92s a good thing to set out upfront.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Right, all that said and after we\'92ve done our work in consulting more than a few of our fellow zoos, we\'92re all lined up here with the ethical conclusion that there is nothing\'a0morally\'a0wrong with courting our four-legged friends who are \'96 in legalistic terms \'96 \'93owned\'94 by another human. Nonhumans, after all, have not only the ability but much more so the\'a0inalienable right\'a0to make the choice to engage in physical, intimate terms with whomever they wish. Consider, if you will, a system in which humans are regarded as property, for the ease of understanding this conclusion. If you fall in love with a human woman, do you go to her owner and ask for permission to date your beloved lady friend? Perhaps, out of a sense of propriety\'85 or because it\'92s safest (legally), or for some other reason outside of the realm of pure ethics. But\'85 if her owner says no, do we recognize a moral imperative to honor that choice even though our newly-beloved says the exact opposite? No, we as zoos most certainly do not!\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0When we put it in straight-up human slavery terms like that, it sounds pretty fucking barbaric, right? In the same way, if we recognize and indeed celebrate the reality of our nonhuman peers as autonomous agents, both willing and more than eager to make their own informed, adult decisions about their own romantic or intimate connections, then there\'92s just\'a0no way\'a0to make that fundamentally zooish recognition sit comfortably alongside some sort of moral requirement that we seek acquiescence from human \'93owners\'94 prior to accepting intimate overtures from a nonhuman love interest. It\'92s wet, or dry \'96 can\'92t be both, not at the same time, no how no way.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Right then, we\'92re all in perfectly unanimous agreement that, looking at things purely from an ethical or moral zooish perspective \'96 just that, no other sides brought into the mix! \'96 not only is there nothing\'a0wrong\'a0with your relationship,\'a0In the Lab,\'a0but that to make such decisions based solely on the wishes of her \'93owners\'94 would be a clear and troubling ethical failure on your part! In the land of pure ethics, it\'92s an open and shut case. Ah but, honey, none of us live in that pure land of ethics, and in this degraded old world of real risks and real consequences, we\'92ve simply got to mesh that purely perfect moral conclusion with the hard facts of living responsible lives: to ourselves, to our communities, and most of all to our nonhuman partners themselves.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Even among humans, if you have a tryst with a young woman without her father\'92s permission, whilst we may all (nowadays) agree that what we\'92ve done is not\'a0morally\'a0wrong, we\'92re all also gonna face up to the fact that there could be consequences if he\'92s inclined to pull out his shotgun. And as backwards as it is morally, in our society nonhumans are \'96 despite many efforts to break in new paradigms and less slavery-based models \'96 legally recognized as property. So we suggest that while you shouldn\'92t feel bad \'96 morally or ethically \'96 about your relationship, basic precautions and practical considerations should be a co-equal concern of yours. She can\'92t balance that side of things \'96 they\'92re human issues, and as the human in your relationship it\'92s 100% up to you to do so on behalf of both of you. Do NOT let your moral clarity cloud the practical responsibilities placed on your shoulders as a result of your wonderful relationship,\'a0ITL.\

\f2\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Zooey:
\f1\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Love has no bounds,\'a0In the Lab. It crosses genders, species, and sometimes, property lines. You have our blessing, as zooish examples in our own (earlier, younger) lives and as zooish folks always putting the views and interests of the nonhumans involved first and foremost.\'a0Buuuut\'85 don\'92t be stupid or reckless, for both your sake and for your beautiful lab\'92s sake. We have a responsibility to our partners to keep them safe, and that always comes before our own needs and desires. Thanks for your very topical letter.\
