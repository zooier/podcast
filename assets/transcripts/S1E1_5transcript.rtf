\f1\fs30 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Hey, everyone! It\'92s your favorite dogmongler Fausty!\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And that Mickey-Mouse-sounding motherfucker, Toggle! A-ha!\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Welcome to this \'93uniquely special\'94 episode of Zooier Than Thou.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Now, normally, this show operates on a monthly basis, but Fausty and I are a pair of April Fools, and the chance for some extra April Foolery was just too much to pass up. Plus the first episode was so much fun\'85\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0It really couldn\'92t have got off to a better start, eh? Even our most optimistic scenarios didn\'92t include thirteen\'a0thousand\'a0bonus impressions on twitter thanks to the #HateParty hashtag\'85 and the tireless promotional assistance from our best friends forever in the \'93hate world\'94\'85 totally serious here: we couldn\'92t have done it without all your help spreading the word! Best. Launch. Ever.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0However, we did receive some very constructive feedback, so without further ado, let\'92s take care of that fake voice of yours, Fausty.\
(Fausty\'92s voice is pitched up)\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What happened? What\'92s wrong with my voice?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I can\'92t actually tell if that\'92s any better.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What are you talking about? This is my normal voice. I always sound like this.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Keep talking, Fausty, we\'92ll get this right eventually.\
(Fausty\'92s voice is pitched down)\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Get what right? What\'92s that knob you\'92re turning? Are you mongling my mic, or something?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0That\'92s actually kind of sexy. You sound like a stallion.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Ahem\'85 I\'a0always\'a0sound like a stallion!\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yeah, like if Barry White was being covered by some white-bread-eating, Canadian stallion.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Fair enough\'85 and I think I can live with that.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Or, maybe kind of like a moose. Like a Mountie Moose giving a public service announcement \'91aboot\'92 wildfires.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well\'85 a big, handsome moose can be proper sexy in his own right, I guess. Not really my cup of tea, eh? I\'92ll stay with the stallion, thanks.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Let\'92s try something else here for a second.\
(Fausty\'92s voice is pitched up at a different timbre)\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Wait\'85 what\'92s wrong with the stallion?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Actually\'85 you kind of sound like me a little bit, if I had a throat cold.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh geez, not that! Plus if you keep this mic-mongling up, you\'92re gonna ruin my carefully-maintained secret persona and\'85 everyone will know who I actually am!\
(Fausty\'92s voice is returned to normal)\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0How\'92s that?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Testing, testing. Ok yeah, that\'92s way better.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0It\'92s amusing that people thought we were using voice modulation on your voice, because we really did consider it. And your voice took surprisingly well to being mongled just now, but we found that we had issues with audio artifacts that rendered the manipulation far too obvious.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0It being 2019 and all, you\'92d think that would be pretty easy to get around.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I certainly did! But we researched it extensively, and all the free to low-cost plug-ins for voice modulation were just sub-par in quality, and even some of the more expensive options didn\'92t perform optimally. There weren\'92t any options in a reasonable price range that actually worked, and there\'92s bigger priorities than protecting you from doxxxing of your super-secret identity.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Sure ok, I know where I stand around here but\'85 what about my voice sounds fake? All that work to change how I sound, and somehow a few clever listeners saw right through it. Damn \'96 and I\'92d have gotten away with it, too, if it weren\'92t for those meddling kids!\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I don\'92t know, it sounded pretty believable to me throughout the show \'96 doesn\'92t really sound like you at all, so there\'92s no way anyone\'92s gonna figure out who you are from your voice.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Phew! Because I\'92m really scared someone\'92s gonna figure out that I\'92m actually Douglas \'91pattern juggled\'92 LeConte-Spink living in Western Pennsylvania. I can\'92t afford to get doxxxed, right? Gotta keep it on the down-low\'85\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Too true. Don\'92t worry \'96 your secret\'92s safe with me! Nobody\'92s gonna crack this mystery, no way no how. Sure, it makes your voice sound all stupid and weird, but it\'92s worth it to keep your identity under cover.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:\'a0
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Thanks, Toggle. You\'92re a real pal! Moving on, let\'92s take a dip into the mail bag. After the first episode went live \'96 and thanks to the #HateParty fillip \'96 we\'92ve been getting inbound comms from all over, from Twitter to Telegram to Kumquat Farms \'97 home of the largest collection of Fausty fan fiction anywhere on the intertubes! Also, a quick plug for all the feedback I\'92ve gotten on my beloved bitmessage! Which reminds me: I\'92ll also put my bitmessage address in the show notes. It\'92s great to hear from everyone, whether it\'92s a quick note hello or a full-bore take on a heavy topic, and we\'92re honored to be part of the conversation. Oh, and those DMs to the ExposeSolution twitter account from a certain lonely closet-case\'85 man thanks so much, you really made our day! No joke, that\'92s just about the funniest thing ever. Anyhow, keep \'91em coming \'96 in particular, on the topic of BeastForum, as that\'92s one we\'92ll be digging back into next episode, for sure.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0This episode, our first e-mail comes from Raccoon in Reno. Raccoon writes: \'93I just wanted to offer my thanks for show. The production was good, some decent laughs, no shortage of puns, but most importantly, some legitimately important information that just doesn\'92t get passed around enough. Being a zoo is certainly no less complicated than any other sexual orientation, but thanks in no small part to living secret lives, we seem to have some of the lowest support. So it\'92s good to see efforts to improve this matter. Looking forward to your next show.\'94\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Raccoon is quite gracious in their feedback and we\'92re grateful for that. Also thanks for providing a spot-on summary of what we\'92re doing here at Zooier Than Thou. This is a time of unprecedented change in the zoo community. Bigotry is on the run, and everyone working for positive, healthy zoo futures is part of a change many of us have worked towards for decades. It\'92s up to all of us in the community to bring out the best in ourselves, working together \'96 the better we do that, the better we\'92re able to continue our work as unique advocates for the holistic best interests of our nonhuman colleagues.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Honestly, Raccoon, you really are picking up what we\'92re putting down, and we couldn\'92t be happier to hear from you. Exposure really is the solution; minority groups gain support through visibility. We\'92ve seen it happen with other sexual and gender minority communities, and since we do share a common history of Biblical bigotry with homosexuality, we could do well to take a page out of their book. And let\'92s be honest, that bigotry has been historically unkind to our animal companions. We do well to remind people where we stand when it comes to the welfare of our four-legged partners.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Supporting each other, our community, and especially our nonhuman peers is what it\'92s all about \'96 that\'92s the foundation on which Zooier Than Thou has been built, right from the start.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What other kind of feedback have you personally received so far, Fausty?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well, the best part for me is how diverse it\'92s been so far \'96 applause, sharp criticism, vague suggestions, detailed recommendations. Overall, I don\'92t think there\'92s a single favorite, for me; what\'92s so inspiring is just the broad swath of conversation the podcast has already helped to encourage.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I think my favorite piece of feedback so far was, \'93Yeah, it was a bit silly for me, but good job.\'94\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yah, fair enough on that \'96 silly, with a bit of good work mixed in along the way.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I also had several people tell me that the last part of the advice segment was both arousing AND informative. Specifically both, not just one or the other.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Now, don\'92t tell anyone\'85 but I\'92m a male, and I haven\'92t met any fellow males in my life who hate blowjobs\'85\'a0(Toggle looks like he might disagree.)\'a0at least if they\'92re done right, eh?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Yeah, OK, if they\'92re done right.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0And, you know, ask a hundred adult males if they\'92d rather receive a gentle, loving, consensual, pleasurable blowjob from a trusted partner\'85 or have their testicles cut off against their will and live the rest of their life suffering the health consequences of that violent genital mutilation\'85 so far I haven\'92t found\'a0anyonewho chooses the castration option. It\'92s almost like one is actually abusive and one isn\'92t\'85 but anyhow, yes, advice on how to share physical intimacy with a loving, adult partner is a good thing \'96 not that anyone would question such an obvious statement \'96 and that segment seems to have been particularly well-received. Seems like blowjobs are, indeed, a popular topic of discussion\'85\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0It certainly seems to come up in non-zoo \'93animal porn\'94 a fair amount.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Oh, man, does it ever. Remember that Hollywood movie:\'a0Porndogs: The Adventures of Sadie?\'a0Lots of allusions to canine blowjobs in that one \'96 which was super-creepy since the boys supposedly receiving them were all visibly castrated. I can\'92t think of a better example of just how broken our society\'92s view of companion species is than a movie that features anatomically-impossible blowjobs given to victims of non-consensual genital mutilation. That\'92s well beyond creepy, into downright sad\'85\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well at least everyone can agree that tongue-in-cheek podcast sex advice that\'a0doesn\'92t\'a0involve violence and amputation is good, clean fun! And unlike\'a0South Park, our dog blowjob segments won\'92t ever get stuck at the \'93red rocket\'94 stage.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Not to\'a0blow off\'a0a great topic of discussion\'85 but what else is on the agenda today?\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well, any production has its bloopers, so we thought we\'92d share a couple of them with you as a parting gift, since it\'92s April Fools Day.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0So am I correct in predicting that \'93bloopers\'94 here is synonymous with \'93Toggle laughing his ass off hysterically?\'94\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0What can I say? I laugh a lot! Our first blooper features our good friend Julia, doing her worst Barbara Walters impression, as far as I can tell. And the second one is just really corny.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Enjoy!\

\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Before we go tonite, friends, we\'92d like to take a break from the lulz to say a few words about something that couldn\'92t be less funny.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Right there with you, Fausty.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Recently, in New Zealand, the dark stain of bigotry and hatred came to a head and took the lives of fifty peaceful citizens at prayer. This terroristic attack has truly shocked the world\'92s conscience, and we humbly offer here our deepest condolences to the victims and their families. Alike or different, of the faith or not, we are all here together \'96 and the sickness of supremacist, neo-Nazi ideology has no place in the world we share. Namaste.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Toggle:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0I\'92m not a very eloquent speaker when it comes to things like this. Words seem so empty in the face of displays of genuine, human evil. We can take an easy moral position and pat ourselves on the back, but our actions really define where we stand. It\'92s truly amazing to see how the indomitable Kiwi spirit is facing this crisis. As an American, seeing their government, their private sector companies, and their whole population coming together as one and working toward real solutions to the problems that have been thrust upon them is moving beyond expression. I think that if I were among those faced with this tragedy, nothing would bring me more solace than knowing that what happened to me wouldn\'92t happen to anyone else. I can\'92t give anything more valuable than that. I\'92m\'85 not sure how to end this, but\'85 let\'92s end with hope that tomorrow is going to be better.\

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 Fausty:
\f2\b0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0Well spoken, my friend. Well spoken. And that\'92s a great note on which to end this \'93mini stallion\'94 episode of Zooier Than Thou.\
